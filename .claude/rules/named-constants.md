# Named constants over repeated literals

A string or numeric literal that is **compared** - `===`, `switch`, a discriminant check, an `includes()` membership
test - at more than one comparison site gets one named constant, or in TypeScript one literal-union type constraining
every use. Never re-type the literal.

Scope the constant to its consumers. Repeats inside a single file stay a module-local `const`; the moment a second file
or a second package needs the value, export it once and import it everywhere. Do not export a constant nothing outside
its own file reads.

Typo drift in a re-typed literal is silent: nothing throws, nothing fails to build, a branch just quietly stops being
taken. Where a literal-union type already exists the compiler catches that, which is why most of this repo's domain tags
(`Backend`, `AudioBus`, `EffectTier`, `EasingFunction`) are already safe. This rule is about everything the compiler is
not watching.

## Reach for the existing type first

Before adding a constant, check whether a literal-union type already describes the domain. Widening that union is better
than standing a parallel constant next to it - the union is the enforcement mechanism, and two sources of truth for one
domain is the problem this rule exists to prevent, not a fix for it.

Name the constant by what it means, not by where it lives; in `packages/blit386/src/**` that naming is governed by
[internal-scoped-naming.md](../../packages/blit386/.claude/rules/internal-scoped-naming.md).

## When it applies

| Situation | Applies |
| --- | --- |
| The same literal compared in two or more files | yes |
| The same literal compared twice in one file | yes - as a module-local `const`, not an export |
| A literal that names something in another package (a version range, a marker string, a file class) | yes |
| A literal that also has to appear in a shader source, a JSON config, or a generated project file | yes - see below |
| A literal used exactly once | no |
| Structural values (`0`, `1`, `-1`) as an index, a length, or a bound | no |
| A test that deliberately hardcodes the expected wire value | no - pinning the literal is the point of the assertion |
| The constant's own definition site | no |

## Crossing out of TypeScript

The hardest version of this is a value that has to exist somewhere the compiler cannot follow: a WGSL or GLSL shader
source string, a JSON config in a sibling package, an HTML template, a file the scaffolder writes into a generated game.

Two options, and only two:

- **Thread the constant through.** Interpolate it into the shader template, derive the JSON at build time, generate the
  file from the same constant the runtime reads.
- **Document the duplication as a manual-sync hazard, at both sites.** A comment on each copy naming the other one, plus
  a line in whatever document governs that workflow.

Two silent hardcoded copies are not an option. That is the exact shape of every drift this rule was written from.

## What this rule would have caught

`GLITCH_TYPES` in `packages/demos` is re-typed as a bare array literal in five demo files. Three of them (`crt-pipboy`,
`snake-game`, `basics-enhanced`) list `hshift`, `chromasplit`, `noise`, `flicker`, `interference`; two of them
(`sprite-effects`, `logo-lowres`) have already diverged to a variant that drops `chromasplit` and adds `vroll`. Every
`this.glitchType === 'hshift'` branch re-types the literal a sixth, seventh, eighth time. Nothing in the toolchain can
tell an intentional variant from a typo here, because plain JavaScript demos have no compiler backstop at all.

## What doing it right looks like

The engine version range genuinely has to exist twice: `BLIT386_RANGE` in `packages/create-blit386/src/scaffold.ts` pins
the engine in a freshly scaffolded game's `package.json`, and `blit386.engineRange` in `packages/kit/package.json` tells
`blit doctor` which engine the kit's guides describe. Different mechanisms, different consumers, same value.

They stay in step because `scripts/bump-lockstep.mjs` writes both, `pnpm run bump:check` re-derives and verifies both
from the engine's own version in CI and pre-push, and `packages/create-blit386/PUBLISHING.md` records that both are
derived, never hand-edited. That is the threading option, done properly: one place decides the value, the coupling is
written down and enforced, and a reviewer who edits one copy by hand is told so.

## Per-package notes

- `packages/demos` is plain JavaScript with no compiler safety net, so shared values live in `src/shared/` next to
  `ui-theme.js` and `post-process-backend.js`, not re-typed per demo.
- `packages/blit386` should widen an existing literal-union type wherever one covers the domain, and interpolate any
  numeric sentinel shared with a WGSL source into the shader template rather than typing it twice.
- `packages/kit` and `packages/create-blit386` describe each other constantly - version ranges, file classes, marker
  strings, ownership manifests. Any literal one package uses to talk about the other is derived or documented, never
  copied. File classes and the paths the kit writes into a generated game (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `docs/`)
  live once in `packages/kit/src/ownership.ts`, which both the adapters that emit those paths and the scaffolder that
  classifies them import.
