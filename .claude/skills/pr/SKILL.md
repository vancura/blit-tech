# Create Pull Request

Create a pull request with automatic quality checks and proper commit message.

## Usage

```text
/pr Add sprite batching optimization
```

The description after `/pr` becomes the commit subject.

## Steps

1. **Verify branch**
   - Confirm current branch is not `main` or `master`
   - Run `git status` to see all changes

2. **Run quality checks**
   - Execute `pnpm preflight` (all checks)
   - If any check fails, stop and report errors
   - Do not proceed with failing checks

3. **Review changes**
   - Run `git diff` to review all modifications
   - Run `git log origin/main..HEAD` to see commits
   - Verify changes align with the description

4. **Create commit**
   - Stage relevant files with `git add`
   - Generate conventional commit message:
     - Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`
     - Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`
     - Scopes: `renderer`, `camera`, `assets`, `api`, `utils`, `ci`, `docs`
   - Include trailers:
     - `Signed-off-by: ...` (DCO required)
     - `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

5. **Push and create PR**
   - Push to remote: `git push -u origin HEAD`
   - Create PR using `gh pr create` with:
     - Title matching commit message
     - Body with summary and test plan
     - Link to related issues if any

6. **Return PR URL**
   - Display the GitHub PR URL for review

## Requirements

- `gh` CLI must be installed and authenticated
- Current branch must not be `main` or `master`
- All quality checks must pass
- All commits must be signed off (DCO)
