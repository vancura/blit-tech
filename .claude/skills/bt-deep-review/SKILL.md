# Deep Review

Comprehensive code review that combines automated checks, AI-powered analysis, and security auditing. Use this before
pushing significant changes or creating pull requests.

## Usage

```text
/bt-deep-review
```

## Steps

1. **Security MCP preflight (when security tooling is in scope)**

- Run `/bt-security-run` or `pnpm run security:mcp-preflight` with the session MCP descriptor path and
  `--allow-fallback`
- See [docs/security/security-runbook.md](../../../docs/security/security-runbook.md)
- Do not skip scans when Opsera/JFrog/Semgrep MCP is degraded; use documented fallbacks

2. **Run preflight checks**

- Execute `pnpm run preflight` (format, lint, typecheck, spellcheck, knip, docs:links, test:unit, test:declarations)
- If any check fails, report issues and stop
- All automated checks must pass before AI review

3. **Run security audit**

- Execute `pnpm run security:audit` (pnpm audit)
- Report any vulnerabilities found (moderate and above)

4. **Gather change context**

- Run `git diff origin/main...HEAD` to see all changes vs. main
- Run `git log origin/main..HEAD --oneline` to see commit history
- Identify which files changed and their purpose

5. **Perform comprehensive code review**

- Analyze the diff for:
  - Bugs and logic errors
  - Security vulnerabilities
  - Performance issues
  - Error handling gaps
  - Code quality issues
  - Adherence to project conventions
- Focus only on high-confidence, high-priority issues
- Verify each issue by reading the actual file contents

6. **Check project-specific rules**

- No emoji anywhere (code, comments, docs, commits)
- Integer coordinates (Vector2i, Rect2i) for all rendering
- TypeScript strict types (no `any`)
- Type imports use `import type` syntax
- Internal scoped naming: private/protected/module-local names must not repeat class or file; public `BT.*` and exports
  unchanged (`CLAUDE.md` **Internal scoped naming**)

7. **Generate PR-ready summary**

- Create a summary suitable for PR description
