  Re-audit open GitHub issues against the current codebase and post a new audit-update comment only when the situation
  has genuinely changed since the last audit.

# Issue Audit Pass

Walk every open issue on `vancura/blit-tech`, compare its last recorded audit comment against the current state of the
code, and post a fresh audit-update comment **only** for issues whose situation is now materially different. Issues
whose feature area has seen no relevant change get nothing.

Use `gh` for all GitHub reads and writes (GitHub MCP is an acceptable substitute if `gh` is unavailable).

## Usage

```text
/bt-issue-audit
```

## Core rule

Add a new comment **only if the situation is now different** from the most recent audit comment on that issue (the audit
bucket, evidence, or recommended status has changed). When in doubt, do not comment. Never restate an unchanged audit.

## Audit buckets

- `not implemented` - no shipped code addresses the ticket
- `partial` - some of the requested surface shipped; concrete gaps remain
- `implemented` - the requested behavior is shipped (candidate to close)

## Comment format

Match the existing audit comments exactly. Every comment starts with a dated heading:

```md
## Audit update (YYYY-MM-DD)

- Audit bucket: <bucket> (was: <previous bucket> on <previous date>)
- Evidence: <specific files / APIs / commits proving the current state>
- Recommended next status: <Keep Backlog | Keep Todo | Close | ...>
- Suggested next step: <concrete action>
```

Include the `(was: ...)` parenthetical only when the bucket actually changed. Cite real symbols and paths (e.g.
`OverlayTimingSnapshot`, `HardwareSettings.isOverlayRendererDiagnosticsBarEnabled`), not vague claims. Plain text only,
no emoji.

## Steps

1. **List open issues and their last audit.**
   - `gh issue list --repo vancura/blit-tech --state open --limit 100 --json number,title,labels,updatedAt`
   - For each issue, pull the most recent audit comment:
     `gh issue view <n> --repo vancura/blit-tech --json comments --jq '.comments[] | select(.body | startswith("## Audit update")) | .body'`
   - Note the date of the latest audit comment per issue. Issues with no audit comment have no baseline - flag them in
     the summary but do not invent a "changed" verdict for them unless the user asks for a first-time audit.

2. **Find what changed in the code since the last audit.**
   - Record each issue's own last-audit date from step 1 (`lastAuditDate` per issue). Audit dates differ between
     issues - never collapse them into a single "most recent across issues" cutoff, or commits that landed between an
     earlier-audited issue's date and that global latest date get missed, yielding false "unchanged" verdicts.
   - For the broad prefilter, use the **earliest** `lastAuditDate` across all issues as the baseline so no relevant
     commit is excluded: `git log --since=<earliest-lastAuditDate> --pretty=format:'%h %ad %s' --date=short`
   - Filter to behavior-changing work: `... | grep -E '(feat|fix)\('`. Ignore `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`,
     and `style` commits - renames and formatting do not change an audit verdict. A breaking rename (`feat(...)!`) can
     matter if it adds or removes public surface.
   - The earliest-baseline log is only a prefilter. Each candidate is judged per issue against its own `lastAuditDate`
     in step 4, not against the global baseline.

3. **Map changed feature areas to issues.**
   - Group the `feat`/`fix` commits by area (overlay, renderer, api, assets, input, etc.) and match them to the open
     issues those areas would affect. Only those issues are candidates for a changed verdict; everything else is
     unchanged by definition.

4. **Verify each candidate against the codebase, per issue.**
   - Compare commits against that issue's own `lastAuditDate`, not the global baseline: a commit only counts toward a
     changed verdict if it landed strictly after the issue was last audited
     (`git log --since=<issue.lastAuditDate> -- <relevant paths>`).
   - Do not trust commit subjects alone. Confirm the actual public surface with `rg` / `git grep` and by reading the
     relevant `src/` files (e.g. confirm an API exists in `src/BlitTech.ts`, a type field in
     `src/core/IBlitTechDemo.ts`, a metric in `src/overlay/`).
   - Re-read the issue body so the verdict addresses what the ticket actually asked for, including partial coverage
     (some sub-points shipped, others not).

5. **Decide and post.**
   - If the bucket / evidence / recommended status is unchanged: post nothing.
   - If it changed: post one audit-update comment in the format above, dated today.
     `gh issue comment <n> --repo vancura/blit-tech --body '<comment>'`
   - Be precise about what shipped and what is still missing; name the residual gap so the ticket can be re-scoped or
     closed.

6. **Summarize for the user.**
   - List which issues got a new comment and why (old bucket -> new bucket).
   - List issues that were candidates but ruled unchanged after verification.
   - List any open issues with no prior audit baseline (e.g. CodeRabbit-only comments) that were skipped.

## Notes

- This is a read-then-write workflow against live GitHub issues. Posting comments is outward-facing; only post the
  comments warranted by step 5. If unsure whether a verdict changed, report it in the summary and let the user decide
  rather than commenting.
- Prefer one comment per genuinely-changed issue. Do not bulk-comment.
- Cross-reference `CLAUDE.md` for the public API shape (getters vs methods, `HardwareSettings` field names) when judging
  whether requested surface actually exists.
