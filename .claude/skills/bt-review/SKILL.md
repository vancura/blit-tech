# Review Changes

Review current changes against project rules and quality standards.

## Usage

```text
/bt-review
```

## Steps

1. **Gather changes**
   - Run `git diff` to see all unstaged modifications
   - Run `git diff --cached` to see staged changes
   - List which files were modified and what changed

2. **Run automated checks**
   - `pnpm run lint` - Report any lint issues
   - `pnpm run typecheck` - Report any type errors
   - `pnpm run spellcheck` - Check for spelling issues

3. **Check against project rules**
   - No emoji anywhere (code, comments, docs, commits)
   - Integer coordinates (Vector2i, Rect2i) for rendering
   - TypeScript strict types (no `any`)
   - Type imports use `import type` syntax
   - Proper error handling (guard clauses, null checks)
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - **BT API shape:** read-only zero-arg snapshots use getters (`BT.logicalSize`, `BT.targetFPS`), not `BT.foo()`.
     Actions and parameterized queries stay methods. New configure mirrors use `HardwareSettings` field names
     (`targetFPS`, not `fps`). Derived getters (e.g. `outputSize`) have no matching field. See `CLAUDE.md` (**BT API:
     getters vs methods**).

4. **Summarize findings**
   - List critical issues that must be fixed
   - List warnings and suggestions for improvement
   - Highlight any security concerns

## Output Format

```md
## Critical Issues

- [File:Line] Description of issue

## Warnings

- [File:Line] Description of warning

## Suggestions

- Consider doing X for better Y

## Summary

Overall assessment of the changes and readiness for a commit.
