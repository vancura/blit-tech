# Performance Testing

Use this skill when the task involves:

- adding or extending `*.bench.ts` files
- benchmarking a new hot method or allocation pattern
- working on benchmark CI behavior

For visual correctness verification (not performance), use `pnpm test:visual` — see the Visual Regression Tests section
in CLAUDE.md.

## CPU Benchmarks

Use Vitest bench for isolated hot paths that can run in Node.

Examples:

- vector math
- color conversion
- rect intersection
- glyph lookup and text measurement
- render-pipeline helper methods that do not require a browser

Commands:

```bash
pnpm bench
pnpm bench:json
```

Rules:

- colocate benchmarks as `*.bench.ts` next to the source
- compare meaningful alternatives in the same file
- prefer realistic hot-path inputs
- use `pnpm bench:json` when validating CI-facing output

## CI Behavior

CPU benchmark regression checks run in CI with the `perf` label.

- `main` pushes run `pnpm bench:json` and refresh the stored baseline artifact
- PRs labeled `perf` run `pnpm bench:json`
- CI compares against the latest successful `main` baseline artifact
- CI posts or updates a PR comment with the comparison table
- CI fails if any benchmark regresses by more than 10%
