# Contributing to Blit-Tech

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Blit-Tech project.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that contributors have the legal right to submit
their contributions. By contributing to this project, you certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by you and you have the right to submit it under the project's
   license.
2. The contribution is based upon previous work that is covered under an appropriate license and you have the right to
   submit that work with modifications.
3. The contribution was provided directly to you by some other person who certified (1) or (2) and you have not modified
   it.

### How to Sign Off Your Commits

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line at the end of the commit message. This line certifies that you agree to
the DCO.

#### Using the `-s` flag

The easiest way to sign off your commits is to use the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(renderer): add circle primitive drawing"
```

This will automatically add the following line to your commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

#### Amending an Existing Commit

If you forgot to sign off a commit, you can amend it:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff
```

Then force push (with lease for safety):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

#### Signing Off Multiple Commits

To sign off all commits in a branch:

```bash
git rebase --signoff origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Automated DCO Check

All pull requests are automatically checked for DCO compliance via GitHub Actions. If any commit is missing the
sign-off, the check will fail and you'll need to add it before the PR can be merged.

## Commit Message Format

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. All commit messages
must be formatted as:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Commit Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `build` - Build system or dependencies
- `ci` - CI configuration
- `chore` - Other changes

### Suggested Scopes

- `renderer` - Rendering system
- `camera` - Camera system
- `assets` - Asset loading
- `api` - Public API (BT namespace)
- `utils` - Utility classes
- `examples` - Example projects
- `ci` - CI/CD configuration
- `docs` - Documentation

### Example Commits

```bash
feat(renderer): add circle primitive drawing

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
```

```bash
fix(assets): handle missing texture gracefully

The asset loader now provides a fallback when texture loading fails.

Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane@example.com>
```

```bash
docs: update API reference section

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
```

## Code Style

All code must follow the project's style guidelines:

- **No emoji** anywhere in code, comments, or documentation
- **TypeScript strict mode** - All code must pass strict TypeScript checks
- **Formatting** - Code is automatically formatted by Biome and Prettier
- **Linting** - Code must pass all linting checks
- **JSDoc** - Required for public APIs

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, run the preflight checks:

```bash
pnpm preflight
```

This runs:

- Code formatting checks
- Linting
- TypeScript type checks
- Spell checking

### Available Commands

```bash
pnpm build            # Build for production
pnpm lint             # Lint code
pnpm lint:fix         # Fix linting issues
pnpm format           # Format code
pnpm format:check     # Check formatting
pnpm typecheck        # Run TypeScript checks
pnpm spellcheck       # Check spelling
pnpm preflight        # Run all quality checks
pnpm sync-rules       # Sync AI rules to editor configs
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all commits are signed off (DCO)
5. Follow the commit message format
6. Run `pnpm preflight` to ensure code quality
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request against `main`

All pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers. The DCO check and other CI checks must pass before a PR can be
merged.
