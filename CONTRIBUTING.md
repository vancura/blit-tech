# Contributing to BLIT386

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the BLIT386 project. By participating, you agree to follow the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

Clone the repository, install dependencies for the whole workspace, then build and test the package you're changing.
This is a pnpm workspace of five packages (`packages/blit386`, `demos`, `website`, `kit`, `create-blit386`);
`pnpm install` at the root sets up all of them, but `build`/`test`/`lint`/etc. are per-package scripts, not root
scripts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blit386/blit386.git
cd blit386
pnpm install
pnpm --filter blit386 run build
pnpm --filter blit386 run test
```

(Substitute `blit386` for whichever package you're working in - `blit386-demos`, `blit386-website`, `@blit386/kit`, or
`create-blit386`. See each package's own `package.json` for the scripts it defines.)

Requirements:

- Node.js >=22.18.0 (`engines` in `package.json`)
- pnpm 11.20.0 (`packageManager` in `package.json`)

Claude Code sessions and the optional [devcontainer](.devcontainer/devcontainer.json) (`typescript-node:22-bookworm`)
auto-run `packages/blit386/scripts/session-start-bootstrap.sh` via their SessionStart hooks / `postCreateCommand`, so a
fresh checkout gets `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` without a manual step. See
[Environment bootstrap](packages/blit386/CLAUDE.md#environment-bootstrap-sessionstart-hook-and-devcontainer) in that
package's `CLAUDE.md` for the full detail.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

This project uses the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) to ensure that contributors have the legal right to submit
their contributions. By contributing to this project, you certify that:

1. The contribution was created in whole or in part by you and you have the right to submit it under the project's
   license.
2. The contribution is based upon previous work that is covered under an appropriate license and you have the right to
   submit that work with modifications.
3. The contribution was provided directly to you by some other person who certified (1) or (2) and you have not modified
   it.

### How to Sign Off Your Commits

All commits must include a `Signed-off-by` line at the end of the commit message. This line certifies that you agree to
the DCO.

#### Using the `-s` flag

The easiest way to sign off your commits is to use the `-s` or `--signoff` flag:

```bash
git commit -s -m "feat(renderer): add circle primitive drawing"
```

This will automatically add the following line to your commit message:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

#### Amending an Existing Commit

If you forgot to sign off a commit, you can amend it:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff
```

Then force push (with lease for safety):

```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```

#### Signing Off Multiple Commits

To sign off all commits in a branch:

```bash
git rebase --signoff origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Automated DCO Check

All pull requests are automatically checked for DCO compliance via GitHub Actions. If any commit is missing the
sign-off, the check will fail and you'll need to add it before the PR can be merged.

## Commit Message Format

This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. All commit messages
must be formatted as:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]

Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

### Commit Types

- `feat` - New feature
- `fix` - Bug fix
- `docs` - Documentation only
- `style` - Formatting, no code change
- `refactor` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf` - Performance improvement
- `test` - Adding or updating tests
- `build` - Build system or dependencies
- `ci` - CI configuration
- `chore` - Other changes
- `revert` - Revert a previous commit

Suggested scopes are conventions only - commitlint does not enforce a scope enum. The canonical list (frequency order)
lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) under Git:

`docs`, `audio`, `assets`, `overlay`, `core`, `api`, `ci`, `renderer`, `tests`, `utils`, `rules`, `release`, `security`,
`input`, `deps` / `deps-dev`, `visual`, `camera`. Rare/legacy: `examples`.

Prefer an existing scope from that list over inventing a new one.

### Example Commits

```bash
feat(renderer): add circle primitive drawing

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
```

```bash
fix(assets): handle missing texture gracefully

The asset loader now provides a fallback when texture loading fails.

Signed-off-by: Jane Smith <jane@example.com>
```

```bash
docs: update API reference section

Signed-off-by: John Doe <john@example.com>
```

## Code Style

All code must follow the project's style guidelines:

- No emoji anywhere in code, comments, or documentation
- TypeScript strict mode - All code must pass strict TypeScript checks
- Formatting - Code is automatically formatted by Biome and Prettier
- Linting - Code must pass all linting checks with zero tolerance for warnings (`eslint --max-warnings 0`; Biome
  diagnostics such as `noExplicitAny` are errors)
- JSDoc - Required for public APIs (ESLint `warn` rules that fail CI via `--max-warnings 0`)

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, run the checks for the package you changed (requires the Node.js version above). Most packages define
a combined `preflight` script - run it if the package has one:

```bash
pnpm --filter blit386 run preflight   # or the package you're working in
```

`kit` and `create-blit386` have no combined `preflight` script (see Available Commands below) - run their individual
`build`, `typecheck`, and `test` scripts, plus the root-level `pnpm run format:check` (neither package defines its own).

Pre-commit (lint-staged) and CI/`preflight` now agree: both reject ESLint warnings and Biome errors. The example above,
`packages/blit386`'s `preflight`, runs:

- Code formatting checks (`format:check`)
- Linting (`lint`, with `--max-warnings 0`)
- TypeScript type checks (`typecheck`)
- Spell checking (`spellcheck`)
- Unused export and dependency checks (`knip`)
- Doc site banner check (`sync:doc-banners:check`)
- API `@since` tag check (`api:since:check`)
- API history manifest check (`api:history:check`)
- `BT.*` getter documentation drift check (`api:getters:check`)
- Unit tests (`test:unit`)
- Declaration tooling tests (`test:declarations`)
- Agent config drift checker tests (`test:agent-config`)
- API history generator tests (`test:api-history`)
- API getter drift checker tests (`test:api-getters`)
- Benchmark comparison script tests (`test:bench-compare`)
- Compact-table Prettier plugin tests (`test:compact-tables`)
- Shell safety hook tests (`test:shell-safety`)
- Spellcheck coverage tests (`test:spellcheck-coverage`)
- Security preflight tests (`test:security-preflight`)

`docs:links` and `agents:check` are **not** part of any package's `preflight`. Each package's copy of those scripts
walks the whole repo from the root regardless of which `package.json` invoked it, so they were pulled out of the
per-package chains to stop a single push running the same full-repo check two to four times. Run them once from the repo
root (`pnpm run docs:links`, `pnpm run agents:check`); `.husky/pre-push` runs them there, alongside the rest of the root
gate, after every changed package's `preflight` passes.

### Available Commands

These are `packages/blit386`'s scripts - the most heavily-tooled package and the one most contributions touch. Run them
from `packages/blit386` directly, or from the repo root with `pnpm --filter blit386 run <script>`. Other packages define
a subset of this list in their own `package.json` (`kit` and `create-blit386` have no combined `preflight`). A handful
of shared checks (`format:check`, `format`, `docs:links`, `agents:check`, `security:audit`, `security:audit:prod`) also
exist as root-level scripts covering files outside any single package.

```bash
pnpm run build                      # Build for production
pnpm run lint                       # Lint code
pnpm run lint:fix                   # Fix linting issues
pnpm run format                     # Format code
pnpm run format:check               # Check formatting
pnpm run typecheck                  # Run TypeScript checks
pnpm run spellcheck                 # Check spelling
pnpm run knip                       # Find unused exports and dependencies
pnpm run docs:links                 # Check Markdown links
pnpm run agents:check               # Check agent config drift (skills symlinks, AGENTS.md pointer, root .mcp.json)
pnpm run sync:doc-banners           # Insert/refresh blit386.dev banners in published docs
pnpm run sync:doc-banners:check     # Check doc site banner drift
pnpm run api:history                # Regenerate API version-history manifest
pnpm run api:since:check            # Check public API @since / @changed / @deprecated tags
pnpm run api:history:check          # Check API version-history manifest drift
pnpm run security:audit             # Dependency security audit (moderate+)
pnpm run security:audit:prod        # Production-deps-only security audit
pnpm run security:mcp-preflight     # MCP security preflight checks
pnpm run test                       # Run unit tests (alias for test:unit)
pnpm run test:unit                  # Run unit tests
pnpm run test:declarations          # Declaration tooling checker tests
pnpm run test:agent-config          # Agent config drift checker tests
pnpm run test:api-history           # API history generator tests
pnpm run test:security-preflight    # Security preflight tests
pnpm run test:visual                # Playwright visual regression (local; not in preflight)
pnpm run bench                      # CPU benchmarks (Vitest bench)
pnpm run preflight                  # Run all quality checks
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Make your changes
4. Ensure all commits are signed off (DCO)
5. Follow the commit message format
6. Run `pnpm run preflight` to ensure code quality
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a pull request against `main`

The pull request form is pre-filled from [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](.github/pull_request_template.md). Use
that checklist for DCO sign-off, Conventional Commit titles, `pnpm run preflight`, documentation updates, and visual
tests when renderer output could change.

All pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers. The DCO check and other CI checks must pass before a PR can be
merged.

## AI-Assisted Contributions

The repository ships a project MCP config at `.mcp.json` declaring `blit386-docs`, the documentation server at
`https://blit386.dev/mcp`. An MCP-capable assistant opened at the repo root picks it up automatically and can search the
engine docs (`search_docs`) or pull the `llms.txt` summary (`get_docs_summary`) without leaving your editor. The server
is public, read-only, and needs no credentials; setup for other clients is documented at
[blit386.dev/mcp-server](https://blit386.dev/mcp-server).

If you use AI tools (like GitHub Copilot or Claude) to help write code, please include the AI trailer in your commit
