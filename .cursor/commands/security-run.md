# Security Run

Deterministic security workflow for the monorepo. Use before comprehensive security scans, hardening passes, or when MCP
scanner availability is uncertain.

## Usage

```text
/security-run <package>
```

Where `<package>` is `blit386` or `demos`. `website`, `kit`, and `create-blit386` have no MCP-backed security scanning -
run their `security:audit` script directly (see `/deep-review <package>` step 3) instead of this skill.

## Prerequisites

- The session's MCP descriptor path (`mcps` folder for the active workspace; agent/tooling-specific)
- Node.js and pnpm per `packages/blit386/package.json`

## Steps

1. MCP preflight (required)

- Read tool schemas before any MCP tool calls (per environment rules)
- Run from `packages/blit386` (canonical script location for both packages):

  ```bash
  pnpm run security:mcp-preflight -- \
    --mcps-dir "<mcps-path>" \
    --repo-root . \
    --allow-fallback \
    --output-json security-reports/mcp-preflight-latest.json
  ```

  For `demos`, either run from `packages/blit386` with `--repo-root ../demos`, or `cd packages/demos` and run with
  `--repo-root .`:
  `node ../blit386/scripts/security/mcp-preflight.mjs --mcps-dir "<mcps-path>" --repo-root . --allow-fallback ...`.

- Record each security MCP status: `healthy`, `auth_required`, `errored`, or `absent`
- If Opsera (`plugin-opsera-devsecops-opsera`) is not `healthy`, do not skip scans; continue with fallbacks from
  [docs/security/security-runbook.md](../../packages/blit386/docs/security/security-runbook.md)

2. Repo-native checks (per package)

- `pnpm run security:audit`
- `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level=moderate`
- `pnpm audit --dev --audit-level=moderate`
- `/preflight <package>`
- `demos` only: `pnpm run build` after dependency/toolchain changes

3. Optional MCP-backed scans (only when healthy)

- Opsera: `architecture-analyze`, `security-scan`, `compliance-audit` (inspect plugin tool schemas first)
- JFrog / Semgrep: only when server status is `healthy`

4. Cross-package (when assessing both)

- Repeat step 2 for the other package, using the same `--mcps-dir` for both

5. Report

- Emit the report template from the runbook
- List every fallback executed and why

## Periodic governance (monthly)

`.github/workflows/mcp-governance-audit.yml` runs a governance-only pass from the repo root automatically every month
and fails (exit 1) if it finds an unaccepted shadow MCP entry - that is the enforced check. Run it by hand only as an
early check or when you specifically need agent-session context; from a package directory:

```bash
pnpm run security:mcp-preflight -- \
  --repo-root . \
  --governance-only \
  --include-user-config \
  --output-json security-reports/mcp-governance-$(date +%Y-%m).json
```

`--mcps-dir` is not required for governance-only calls - that mode never reads the MCP session's tool-state folder, only
static `*.mcp.json` files.

Then run it once more with the monorepo root as `--repo-root` (`--repo-root ../..` from a package directory), keeping
`--include-user-config` and writing to a distinct `--output-json` path so the repo-root report does not overwrite the
per-package one. `discoverMcpConfigPaths` only walks one level up, so a package-rooted run never reaches the repo root
and never scans the tracked root `.mcp.json`.

Review shadow MCP flags. Exactly one entry is accepted, and only when all four fields match: name `blit386-docs`,
classification `shadow-remote`, config path the repo-root `.mcp.json`, and URL `https://blit386.dev/mcp`. A shadow count
of one matching all four is a clean run; anything else - a different name, a different config path, or the same name
pointing elsewhere - is a finding, not an accepted entry. See "Accepted MCP entries" in the runbook. This is no longer
just a human judgment call: the report's `governance.unacceptedShadowServers` and `summary.proceed` (the exit code)
already reflect it, matched against `ACCEPTED_SHADOW_MCP_ENTRIES` in `mcp-preflight.mjs` (name and classification;
config path is checked against the repo root's own `.mcp.json`) - the URL field is enforced separately by
`pnpm run agents:check`, so a finding here still needs a human to decide migrate/remove vs. update the allowlist.

The preflight report prints name, classification, and config path but not the URL, so the URL half is enforced
separately by `pnpm run agents:check` (`findProjectMcpFailures` in `scripts/check-agent-config.mjs`). It pins the
literal `https://blit386.dev/mcp` rather than just comparing the root `.mcp.json` against the website's discovery card,
so a coordinated edit aiming both files at another host fails CI too.

Report exactly the three fields the runbook's report template asks for - server name, classification, and config path -
and nothing else. Never output secrets, credentials, auth headers, or a full MCP config body. Rewrite config paths
repo-relative before pasting them anywhere: the preflight prints absolute paths, so a copied report otherwise leaks the
local username.
