/**
 * Cross-process exclusive lock for a "check freshness, build if stale" self-heal script. Shared by
 * `ensure-engine-built.mjs` and `ensure-kit-built.mjs`: both shell out from `packages/demos` and
 * `packages/website`, which pnpm's default workspace concurrency runs in parallel (`.husky/pre-push`'s
 * `pnpm --filter "...[ref]" run preflight`, or a plain `pnpm -r build`). Without a lock, two processes
 * can both see a stale `dist/` at the same instant and both spawn an independent rebuild writing into
 * the same `dist/` at once - confirmed to intermittently corrupt `vite-plugin-dts`/API Extractor's
 * declaration bundling with errors like "referenced path was not found: .../amber.d.ts".
 *
 * `acquireLockOrConfirmBuilt` serializes the actual build behind an exclusive lock directory
 * (`mkdirSync` is atomic) so only the process that wins the race builds; every other process either
 * finds the target already fresh (built by the winner while it waited) or waits for the lock to free
 * up and then re-checks. A lock is reclaimed as abandoned only when its recorded pid is confirmed
 * dead via `process.kill(pid, 0)` (a build killed mid-run: crash, Ctrl-C) or, if the pid can't even be
 * read, once the lock directory itself is older than `LOCK_STALE_MS` - never merely because a waiter
 * has personally been polling a long time, so a legitimately slow but live build is never evicted out
 * from under itself no matter how long anyone has been waiting on it.
 *
 * Reclaiming a lock never deletes it in place: `reclaimAbandonedLock` atomically renames it to a
 * private path first (`renameSync`, so exactly one waiter can win the rename against every other
 * waiter reaching the same conclusion at the same time) and only then inspects and deletes the moved
 * copy - and if that copy turns out to belong to a pid that is alive after all (recreated by another
 * process between this waiter's freshness check and its reclaim attempt), it is moved back instead of
 * destroyed. A plain `rmSync(lockDir)` cannot do either: two waiters that both see the same abandoned
 * lock can otherwise have the second one delete the *new*, live lock the first one just created after
 * winning the race and starting its build.
