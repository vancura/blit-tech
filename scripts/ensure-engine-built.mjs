/**
 * Build the BLIT386 engine automatically when `packages/blit386/dist` is missing - the case for
 * every freshly created checkout or git worktree, since `dist/` is gitignored and only a build
 * produces it. Shared by `packages/demos` and `packages/website`, which hit this in different
 * ways: `packages/demos/vite.config.js` imports `blit386/vite` at the top of the file,
 * unconditionally, so `dev`, `build`, `preview`, and `knip` (which loads `vite.config.js` via its
 * own Vite plugin) all crash before that import is even reached; `packages/website`'s Twoslash
 * pipeline compiles docs samples against the workspace engine (BT-414), so its `test` and `build`
 * fail inside that compilation with TS2307 instead. Run before any of those so the failure
 * self-heals instead of surfacing as a confusing "Cannot find module" error partway through
 * `git push`.
 *
 * Also rebuilds when `dist/` exists but is stale - newer than the checked-in build, but older than
 * `packages/blit386/src`. The engine bundles from roughly 250 source files under `src/`, any one of
 * which can change the public API, so - unlike a single-entry proxy that could miss a change to a
 * file it doesn't happen to re-export through - the whole tree is walked for its newest mtime. That
 * walk is still one `readdirSync` plus one `statSync` per file, not a build: on this codebase's
 * source tree it costs low single-digit milliseconds, negligible next to the seconds a real rebuild
 * takes, so it stays a fast no-op on every normal `demos`/`website` dev, build, test, or `knip` run.
 *
 * A no-op once the engine is built and fresh - one existsSync plus one small directory walk is the
 * only cost on every normal run.
 *
 * Concurrency-safe via `build-lock.mjs` - see that file's header for why (two processes racing this
 * script's TOCTOU check-then-build against a shared `dist/` intermittently corrupted each other's
 * output) and how (an exclusive, pid-backed lock directory).
 *
 * Usage (from a package directory):
 *   node ../../scripts/ensure-engine-built.mjs
