/**
 * Regression test for BT-460: cspell-gitignore's findRepoRoot() prefers a farther-up .git
 * DIRECTORY (the main checkout) over a nearer .git FILE (a linked worktree), so inside a
 * worktree it resolves to the wrong repo root. The main checkout's .gitignore then matches
 * every worktree file against its `.claude/worktrees/` rule, silently filtering all of them
 * out - each package's spellcheck script reports "Files checked: 0" and cspell exits 1 because
 * --no-must-find-files (used only in .lintstagedrc.json, not in these scripts) isn't set.
 *
 * A silent zero is the actual failure mode: exit 1 gets noticed, but a future regression that
 * keeps exit 0 while checking nothing would not. This asserts the file count directly for every
 * package with a spellcheck script, running each package.json's own "spellcheck" command exactly
 * as written (not `pnpm run` - pnpm's own reporter writes straight to the controlling terminal in
 * some nested-PTY setups, bypassing stdout capture). It intentionally does not construct a
 * synthetic worktree fixture to force the bug: cspell-gitignore resolves the repo root by
 * shelling out to git rather than pure directory-walking, so a synthetic non-git ".git" directory
 * doesn't reproduce it faithfully, and a real `git worktree add` needs its own `pnpm install`,
 * too slow and network-dependent for a regression test. Running this test itself from inside a
 * real linked worktree (any `.claude/worktrees/*` checkout) already exercises the real bug shape.
