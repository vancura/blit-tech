/**
 * Build `@blit386/kit` automatically when `packages/kit/dist` is missing - the case for every
 * freshly created checkout or git worktree, since `dist/` is gitignored and only a build produces
 * it. `packages/blit386/scripts/gen-deprecations.mjs` imports `MIGRATIONS` from
 * `packages/kit/dist/migrations/registry.js`, so a tag-less/dist-less checkout would otherwise fail
 * with a confusing "Cannot find module" error. Mirrors `ensure-engine-built.mjs`, including its use
 * of `build-lock.mjs` (see that file's header for why: two processes racing the same TOCTOU
 * check-then-build against a shared dist/ intermittently corrupt each other's output).
 *
 * Also rebuilds when `dist/` exists but is stale - newer than the checked-in build, but older than
 * `packages/kit/src`. tsup bundles `migrations/registry.js` from `registry.ts` plus whatever it
 * imports, so the whole `src/` tree (not just `registry.ts`) is the honest staleness signal; the
 * kit is small enough (a handful of files) that walking it on every run stays cheap.
 *
 * A no-op once the kit is built and fresh - one existsSync plus one small directory walk is the
 * only cost on every normal run.
 *
 * Usage (from a package directory):
 *   node ../../scripts/ensure-kit-built.mjs
