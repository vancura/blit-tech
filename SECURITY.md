# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
| ------- | --------- |
| 1.x     | Yes       |
| 0.x     | No        |

The **1.x** release line is actively maintained. Security fixes are published as patch releases on **1.x**. Pre-1.0
(**0.x**) releases reached end-of-life at **1.0.0** and no longer receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in a supported **1.x** release, please report it responsibly.

**Do not open a public issue.** Instead, email the maintainers directly or use
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/vancura/blit-tech/security/advisories/new).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. Once resolved, we will publish a fix on
the supported **1.x** line and credit you in the release notes (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

## Scope
