 * - A `'pixel'` chain at the logical render resolution (e.g. 320x240).
 * - A `'display'` chain at the canvas output resolution (e.g. 1280x960).
 *
 * Each chain owns its own offscreen color texture(s) and a shared sampler that
 * effects sample from. Resources are allocated lazily: nothing is touched on
 * the GPU until an effect is added, and everything is destroyed when the chain
 * empties via {@link clear} or the last {@link remove}.
 *
 * Texture model:
 * - Zero effects: no textures allocated, {@link isActive} returns `false`.
 * - One effect: only `texA` exists. The previous stage renders into `texA`; the
 *   effect samples `texA` and writes directly to the final destination view.
 * - N >= 2 effects: `texB` is also allocated. The previous stage renders into
 *   `texA`; intermediate effects ping-pong between `texA` and `texB`; the final
 *   effect writes to the destination view regardless of which buffer it sampled
 *   from.
 *
 * Effect ordering is the order of {@link add} calls.
