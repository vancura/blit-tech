 *   Use for effects that stay in index space: glitch shifts, mosaic blocks,
 *   index inversion. Effects in this tier should avoid introducing values that are
 *   not meaningful palette slots (e.g. blurs, gradients).
 * - `'display'` - runs at the canvas output resolution (e.g. 1280x960) after
 *   palette resolve/upscale. Use for effects that simulate the physical display the
 *   game appears on: CRT scanlines, barrel distortion, RGB shadow mask,
 *   vignette, chromatic aberration, monochrome amber/green, bloom, etc. The
 *   higher resolution lets curved sampling (barrel) express smoothly without
 *   floor-quantizing onto the logical pixel grid.
