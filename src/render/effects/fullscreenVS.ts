/**
 * Shared WGSL vertex stage for full-screen post-processing effects.
 *
 * Emits a single oversized triangle that covers the entire NDC quad (-1..1).
 * Drawing 3 vertices is faster than 6 for a quad and avoids the diagonal seam
 * where two triangles meet, which can otherwise produce visible artifacts in
 * effects that derive screen-space gradients.
 *
 * Texture coordinates flip the Y axis so the source texture (origin top-left)
 * maps correctly under the WebGPU clip-space convention (origin bottom-left).
 *
 * Effects compose this string into their full shader module alongside their
 * fragment stage. Bind group 0 is reserved for effect uniforms; effects may
 * declare additional bindings as needed.
 *
 * Draw with `pass.draw(3, 1, 0, 0)`.
