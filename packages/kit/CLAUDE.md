# @blit386/kit

Canonical kit content (the IR) and the `blit` CLI, shipped into every game scaffolded by `create-blit386`. This package,
`create-blit386`, and the `blit386` engine release in lockstep (one shared `x.y.z`, anchored to the engine's semver) -
see [`packages/create-blit386/CLAUDE.md`](../create-blit386/CLAUDE.md) for the scaffolder's own detail.

Shared monorepo conventions (no emoji, dash typography, American English, commit format, DCO, `main` protection, compact
tables, …) live in the root [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) - read together with this file.

TypeScript strict, built with tsup, Biome for lint and format (no ESLint here), pnpm, Node >= 22.18.0. Scripts are
`pnpm run <script>` from this package's directory (or `pnpm --filter @blit386/kit run <script>` from the repo root).

The `blit` CLI is a project-local bin inside every generated game: `blit run`, `blit doctor`, `blit upgrade`,
`blit migrate`, `blit agents sync` / `blit agents add`, `blit clean`, `blit help`.

## Kit content vs engine docs

Generated games receive `AGENTS.md`, nine beginner docs from `content/docs/` (`getting-started`, `basics`, `drawing`,
`input`, `palette`, `random`, `audio`, `hot-reload`, `when-something-breaks`), and the game-author skills in
`content/skills/`. These are not copies of the engine's full `docs/` tree - they teach the starter game and route
anything deeper to the live documentation at blit386.dev: the `blit386-docs` MCP server (`search_docs`,
`get_docs_summary`), `https://blit386.dev/llms.txt`, or any doc page fetched with `Accept: text/markdown`. GitHub is the
last resort, for when the documentation itself falls short.

The whole of `content/` is the shipped IR, not just `AGENTS.md` + `docs/`: it also carries `rules/`, `skills/` (24
game-author capability skills plus the `run`, `fix`, `migrate`, and `ask-the-docs` workflow skills),
`hooks/shell-safety.sh` + `hooks.manifest.json`. Skills and rules are discovered by directory scan in `src/adapters.ts`
\- adding a skill folder is enough, nothing registers it by name.

Kit content must be self-contained. Skills and docs may reference only `packages/blit386` (the engine) and other local
kit files. Do not reference the `packages/demos` package, its demo slugs, or its URLs - that package may be archived in
favor of kit-based demos, and shipped content must not break with it.

The engine has no physics, collision, entity, or scene system. Say so; do not invent one. What the kit does teach:
drawing (primitives, sprites, text), palette and effects, input (keyboard, pointer, gamepad), timing and easing, audio
(bus mixer, `AudioClip`, procedural synth - engine 1.3.0), hot reload / `blit386/vite` / asset hot-replace /
`BT.loadingAssetsCount` (engine 1.4.0), `BT.isDevMode` dev/release detection, `BT.random` and the noise/hash world
generation surface, and the exposure-curve palette fade (engine 1.5.0), the debug overlay, screenshots, and WebGPU-only
post-process effects.

### Drift is the standing risk here

Nothing syncs this package from `packages/blit386` automatically. The kit docs and shipped skills are hand-authored
beginner prose, so they go stale silently when the engine changes. Shipping an engine feature is the trigger to come
here - review in the same pass, not later. Run `/kit-audit` to walk the checklist. `BLIT386_RANGE` in
`packages/create-blit386/src/scaffold.ts` needs no manual check - `pnpm run bump:check` (repo root) verifies it against
`blit386.engineRange` on every push and in CI.

`scripts/check-kit-docs-drift.mjs` (repo root) automates a coarse, page-level version of this table's triggers for
`content/docs/*.md` only, comparing `packages/blit386/docs/_api-history.json` against `blit386.docsReviewedAt`
(`package.json`) and, on `push` to `main` or weekly, filing/updating a Linear tracking issue
(`.github/workflows/kit-docs-drift.yml`). It does not replace this table or `/kit-audit`, and does not cover
`content/skills/*` or the other kit files below.

| Kit file | Review when |
| --- | --- |
| `content/docs/getting-started.md` | Install/run flow, `npx blit run` / `doctor`, first-edit hot reload |
| `content/docs/basics.md` | `configure()`, loop timing getters, bootstrap flow, orientation, `loadingAssetsCount`, the splash and its off switch |
| `content/docs/drawing.md` | `BT.clear`, primitives, text APIs |
| `content/docs/input.md` | `BT.isDown`, edges, keyboard, pointer, gamepad, scroll-capture / touch-action |
| `content/docs/palette.md` | `paletteCreate`, slots, `Color32`, the two whole-screen fades |
| `content/docs/random.md` | `BT.random` / `BT.randomSeed`, seeding a run, noise and hash world generation |
| `content/docs/audio.md` | `AudioClip`, `BT.synthPreset`, buses, the unlock rule |
| `content/docs/hot-reload.md` | `blit386/vite`, swap tiers, `onHotReload`, asset hot-replace, `BT.isDevMode` |
| `content/docs/when-something-breaks.md` | Common errors, `await`, palette slot 0, silent audio, hot-reload surprises |
| `content/AGENTS.md` | Overall game shape, hard rules, doc routing, hot-reload tiers |
| `content/rules/blit-api-names.md` | `BT` getters, configure flags, wake lock, `onHotReload` / never `registerHotReload` |
| `content/rules/blit-integer-coords.md` | Integer-coordinate rule (`Vector2i` / `Rect2i`) |
| `content/skills/use-hot-reload/SKILL.md` | Swap tiers, `onHotReload`, vite plugin opt-in for older games |
| `content/skills/use-dev-mode/SKILL.md` | `BT.isDevMode` resolution order, cheat-key / debug-HUD gating examples |
| `content/skills/show-a-loading-screen/SKILL.md` | `BT.loadingAssetsCount`, per-sheet status, and how the splash already covers `init()` |
| `content/skills/use-random/SKILL.md` | `BT.random` / `BT.randomSeed`, `Random` methods, state and stream helpers |
| `content/skills/use-noise/SKILL.md` | `hash*` functions, `ValueNoise` / `PerlinNoise` / `SimplexNoise`, fBm defaults |
| `content/skills/move-and-time/SKILL.md` | Clock getters, `Timer`, the `EasingFunction` curve list, `interpolate` |
| `content/skills/animate-the-palette/SKILL.md` | Cycle / fade / exposure fade / flash / swap, `highlightLead` |
| `content/skills/ask-the-docs/SKILL.md` | The docs MCP tool set, `llms.txt`, or the site's markdown negotiation changes |
| `content/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Other game-author skills; each demonstrates a slice of the `BT` surface |
| `content/hooks/shell-safety.sh` | Shell commands the hook blocks in a generated game (Cursor + Claude protocols) |
| `content/hooks/session-start.sh` | Dependency install + `blit doctor` checkup a fresh remote/web session runs (Claude-only; Cursor has no SessionStart-equivalent event) |
| `content/hooks.manifest.json` | Canonical hook intent; Cursor `hooks.json` and Claude `settings.json` derive from it |
| `src/adapters.ts` (docs-MCP config) | `packages/website/public/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` changes name, URL, or transport |

While auditing, confirm every skill directory appears in the skills table in `README.md` - that is the only human-facing
list of what ships, and it has no automated guard.

## Critical rules

1. Beginner-friendly - kit docs and skills assume no prior coding experience
2. Integer coordinates - generated games use `Vector2i` / `Rect2i` via blit386
3. Use the `BT` namespace in generated game code, never `BTAPI`
4. Named exports only in this package's own TypeScript; no default exports
5. `blit386.engineRange` in `package.json` is derived, not hand-edited - `scripts/bump-lockstep.mjs` (repo root) writes
   it together with `BLIT386_RANGE` in `packages/create-blit386/src/scaffold.ts`, and `pnpm run bump:check` fails the
   build when either drifts. `blit386.docsReviewedAt` is the opposite case - hand-set only, bumped by whoever actually
   reviewed `content/docs/*.md` against a new engine release; no script writes it, `scripts/check-kit-docs-drift.mjs`
   (repo root) only reads it. Any other literal this package uses to describe the engine or the scaffolder follows the
   same derive-or-document discipline: file classes and generated-project paths live once in `src/ownership.ts`, and the
   `.blit/manifest.json` path and shape live once in `src/manifest.ts` - both of which `create-blit386` imports through
   `@blit386/kit/adapters`. The manifest is written by two packages and read by one, so its declaration is authored once
   (`BlitManifest`) and the reader's leniency toward manifests from older scaffolders is _derived_ from it
   (`ReadBlitManifest`), never hand-maintained as a second interface. Same discipline, one boundary further out:
   `MCP_SERVER_NAME` and `MCP_SERVER_URL` in `src/adapters.ts` are a documented copy of
   `packages/website/public/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json`, which this package cannot import;
   `test/mcp-config.test.mjs` compares the two, so the copy fails loudly instead of drifting. See root
   `.claude/rules/named-constants.md` for the shared policy
6. Never re-derive the kit's package root at a call site - `src/kit-root.ts` holds the only implementation of each of
   the two answers, and they are not interchangeable. See below

## Two ways to find the kit root, and which one you want

`src/kit-root.ts` is the single home for both. Picking the wrong one is silently wrong rather than broken, so the choice
is worth a moment:

| Question | Function | Who asks it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Which kit contains this running code? | `kitRoot()` | The `blit` CLI, which ships inside a game's `node_modules` and must read its own `content/`; `src/env.ts`'s `package.json` readers |
| Which kit does the caller's package depend on? | `resolveKitRoot(import.meta.url)` | `create-blit386`, which copies that kit's `content/` into a new game and pins its version in the generated `package.json` |

Both are re-exported from `src/adapters.ts`, this package's only published subpath. They point at the same directory in
a normal install and diverge under bundling, `pnpm link`, and hoisting - which is why there is one implementation of
each rather than one of either.

`kitRoot()` walks up to the nearest `package.json` named `@blit386/kit` **on purpose**. Do not "simplify" it back to
`new URL('../package.json', import.meta.url)`: that is only correct for a module emitted at `dist/` root, and tsup also
emits `dist/migrations/*.js` a level down and splits shared code into `chunk-*.js` whose placement is an esbuild
implementation detail. The walk also turns "bundled into another package" from a wrong answer into a thrown error.
`test/kit-root.test.mjs` covers both, including a guard that fails if the hardcoded-depth idiom reappears anywhere in
`dist/`.

## Where to find information

| Question | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| What does the `blit` CLI do? | `src/cli.ts`, `README.md` |
| How are agent files generated? | `src/adapters.ts`; every path it emits is built from `src/ownership.ts`, and the scaffolder writes them to disk |
| Docs-MCP config shipped into games | `buildMcpConfig` in `src/adapters.ts`; canonical server definition lives in `packages/website` |
| What do `blit agents sync` / `add` do? | `src/commands/agents.ts` (drift `--check` + write path, `runAddAgent`) |
| How do API migrations / codemods work? | `src/migrations/` (registry + codemod engine), `src/commands/migrate.ts` |
| Sync ownership model / manifest | `src/manifest.ts` (where the manifest lives and what shape it has), `src/commands/agents.ts` (the read/reconcile/write algorithm) |
| Which files the kit owns, and the paths it writes into a game | `src/ownership.ts` - shared with `create-blit386` via `@blit386/kit/adapters` |
| How the kit finds its own root, and how the scaffolder finds the installed kit | `src/kit-root.ts` - `kitRoot()` vs `resolveKitRoot()`, both re-exported from `src/adapters.ts` |
| Engine API names for generated games | `packages/blit386/CLAUDE.md`, `packages/blit386/docs/api-core.md` |
| What does the scaffolder generate? | `packages/create-blit386/CLAUDE.md` |
| Publishing / release | `packages/create-blit386/PUBLISHING.md`, `/release`, `pnpm run bump -- 1.5.0` from the repo root (replace `1.5.0` with the target version) |
| Maintainer agent-config drift check | `scripts/check-agent-config.mjs` (root) |
| Lockstep version / range drift check | `pnpm run bump:check` (root `scripts/bump-lockstep.mjs --check`) |
| Kit docs drift check + Linear filing | `scripts/check-kit-docs-drift.mjs`, `scripts/report-kit-docs-drift.mjs` (root), `.github/workflows/kit-docs-drift.yml` |
| Contributing / DCO | root `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
