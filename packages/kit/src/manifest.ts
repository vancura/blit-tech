 * `BlitManifest` is required of every writer and simultaneously visible to the reader.
 *
 * This is also the shape `sync` and `add` write, not just read, and the two widened root fields are
 * treated differently on the way out. `createdAt` is copied across only when the manifest they read
 * had it, so a legacy manifest never gains a fabricated creation timestamp. `vars` is copied across
 * when present but *backfilled* when absent: `sync` resolves it from `fallbackVars` and writes it
 * back, so a legacy manifest gains `vars` on its first sync - deliberately, so the package manager
 * is detected once rather than re-detected on every run. `add` backfills the same way, but only on
 * the path where it completes: a generated file colliding with an untracked user file aborts it
 * before the manifest is touched at all.
 *
 * Deliberately not a schema version. A version field is absent from every manifest already in the
 * wild, so the reader would keep this widened branch indefinitely and gain a second one beside it;
 * and the v0-to-v1 upgrade that would justify the fork cannot be written honestly, since it would
 * have to invent a `createdAt` that no one knows.
