/**
 * `blit agents <add|sync>` - manage AI-assistant files from the kit's canonical content.
 *
 * `sync --check` is report-only: reads `.blit/manifest.json`, computes current SHA-256 hashes
 * for kit-owned and shared files, and reports any that have drifted from their generated state.
 * Exits non-zero when drift is found so it is safe to use in CI and inside `blit doctor`.
 *
 * `sync` (no flag) is the write path: it regenerates what the installed kit would emit, then
 * applies the ownership model (section 4.10 of the design doc) to update the project without
 * clobbering user edits:
 *   - kit-owned files the user has not touched are overwritten;
 *   - shared files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md) get only their managed region rewritten;
 *   - kit-owned files the user edited are three-way merged when git is available, otherwise saved
 *     alongside as `<file>.new`;
 *   - user-owned files are never touched.
 * `--force [path...]` overwrites the named files (or all kit-managed files) with the kit version.
 *
 * `add <claude|cursor>` sets up the files for one AI assistant in a project that did not pick it at
 * scaffold time. It regenerates that assistant's adapter output from the installed kit, writes the new
 * files, and records them in the manifest (so later `sync` runs keep them fresh). It never clobbers an
 * existing file it does not already track: such a file is saved alongside as `<file>.new` instead.
