/**
 * Finding the kit's package root - the only place either answer is implemented.
 *
 * There are two of them because there are two genuinely different questions, and code that asks the
 * wrong one is silently wrong rather than broken:
 *
 *   - `kitRoot()` - "the kit containing me". For code that ships inside the kit and must find
 *     itself: the `blit` CLI running from a generated game's `node_modules`, and the kit's own
 *     `package.json` readers in `./env`. Node resolution would be wrong here, because a hoisted
 *     sibling copy could answer instead of the kit actually executing.
 *
 *   - `resolveKitRoot(fromUrl)` - "the kit this package depends on". For code outside the kit acting
 *     on the kit npm installed beside it: `create-blit386`, which copies that kit's `content/` into
 *     a new game and pins its version in the generated `package.json`. Bundle-relative would be
 *     wrong here, because if `@blit386/kit` were ever inlined into the caller's bundle it would
 *     quietly return the caller's own root.
 *
 * Both are re-exported through `./adapters`, the kit's only published subpath.
