 * How a rename is matched in source code.
 *
 * - `memberCall`: a call on a fixed receiver, e.g. `BT.buttonDown(` -> `BT.isDown(`. Anchored on the receiver, so it is
 *   unambiguous and safe to apply automatically.
 * - `objectKey`: a property key in an object literal, e.g. `overlayEnabled:` -> `isOverlayEnabled:`. Anchored on the
 *   trailing colon.
 * - `method`: a method call on an unknown receiver, e.g. `.intersectionTo(` -> `.intersectTo(`. Only safe when the old
 *   name is distinctive enough to not collide with unrelated code.
 * - `importPath`: a quoted module specifier, e.g. `from 'blit-tech'` -> `from 'blit386'` and
 *   `require('blit-tech')` -> `require('blit386')`. Matches any occurrence of the string inside single or double quotes.
