/**
 * Filesystem-safety primitives shared by every `blit` command that reads or writes project files by a

 * hashing used to detect drift from a tracked file's last known content.
 *
 * A leaf module on purpose: no imports beyond node builtins, so both `commands/agents.ts` and
 * `commands/clean.ts` can depend on it without a cycle. Kept as one implementation rather than two
 * copies because a symlink-safety bug fixed in one copy and not the other is exactly the kind of drift
 * these checks exist to prevent.
