# @blit386/kit

The kit behind [BLIT386](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386) game projects: the canonical AI/human docs plus the
`blit` helper CLI. You normally do not install this yourself -
[`create-blit386`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-blit386) adds it to a new game for you.

## What's inside

- The `blit` CLI - a small helper you run inside a BLIT386 game:
  - `blit run` - start the dev server and open the game.
  - `blit doctor` - check Node, git, and the installed `blit386` version.
  - `blit upgrade` - update `blit386` to the latest version, with a friendly nudge if your work is not under git. After
    a version change it checks your game for old API names and offers to update them for you (see `blit migrate`).
  - `blit migrate` - update old BLIT386 names in your game to the current ones, and (on blit386 1.4.0+) enable hot
    reload in `vite.config` when it is missing. It previews the changes by default and only writes them when you add
    `--write`. Safe, unambiguous renames are applied; names that are too common to change automatically (like `equals`)
    are listed for you or your AI assistant to handle.
  - `blit agents sync` - refresh the AI-assistant files from the installed kit. It keeps your edits: kit-owned files you
    have not touched are updated in place, shared files (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) get only their managed region
    rewritten, and a file you changed is three-way merged (or saved next to yours as `<file>.new`). Use `--check` to
    report drift without writing (CI-safe; `blit doctor` runs it too), or `--force [path...]` to take the kit version
    back. Once sync has merged your edits into a kit file, `--check` treats that file as settled - it will not keep
    reporting it as drifted.
  - `blit agents add <claude|cursor>` - set up the files for one AI assistant in a game that did not pick it at the
    start. It writes the new files and records them so `blit agents sync` keeps them fresh. It never overwrites a file
    you already have; if one is in the way it saves the kit version next to it as `<file>.new`.
  - `blit clean` - replace `src/game.ts` (or `src/game.js`) with an empty skeleton: the same `init`/`update`/`render`
    shape, no drawing, no input handling, ready for your own code. No other project file is touched other than
    `.blit/manifest.json`'s tracked hash for it, kept in step so later drift checks do not flag the skeleton as
    modified. Warns before replacing a file that no longer matches what was scaffolded, and always asks first - add
    `--yes` to skip the prompt.
  - `blit help` - list the commands.
- `content/` - everything a scaffolded project ships so a person or an AI assistant can learn the engine from inside the
  project: the canonical `AGENTS.md` and `docs/`, the engine API `rules/`, the game-author `skills/` (listed below), and
  the agent `hooks/` plus `hooks.manifest.json`. Claude/Cursor file generation lives in `src/adapters.ts` and is
  exported as `@blit386/kit/adapters` so the scaffolder and `blit agents sync` / `blit agents add` share one
  implementation; the paths it emits and their sync ownership classes are defined once in `src/ownership.ts`. The same
  manifest drives Cursor's `.cursor/hooks.json` and Claude Code's `.claude/settings.json` (format-on-edit +
  block-dangerous-shell). Claude Code also gets a SessionStart hook that installs dependencies and runs `blit doctor`
  when a fresh remote/web session starts, so a scaffolded game works without manual setup; Cursor has no
  SessionStart-equivalent event, so it does not get this hook. Both adapters also emit a documentation-MCP config -
  `.mcp.json` for Claude Code, `.cursor/mcp.json` for Cursor - registering the `blit386-docs` server at
  `https://blit386.dev/mcp` so an assistant can search the live docs. Claude Code asks once whether to allow it.

## The game-author skills

Every scaffolded game gets these. Your AI assistant loads one on its own when the task calls for it - you do not have to
name them. In Claude Code they live in `.claude/skills/`; in Cursor they are slash commands in `.cursor/commands/`, so
there you can also invoke one by name (`/add-sprite`).

| Skill | What it is for |
| --- | --- |
| `structure-a-game` | The shape of a game: `configure`, `init`, `update`, `render` - and what the engine does not do for you |
| `run` | Start the dev server and see the game |
| `fix` | The game crashes, shows a black screen, or behaves oddly |
| `ask-the-docs` | Look something up that the local `docs/` folder does not cover, using the live docs at blit386.dev |
| `use-hot-reload` | Keep playing while you edit code or assets (`blit386/vite`, `onHotReload`) |
| `use-dev-mode` | Gate debug HUDs, cheat keys, and verbose logging on `BT.isDevMode` |
| `draw-shapes` | Rectangles, lines, pixels, and clearing the screen |
| `add-sprite` | Load a PNG sprite sheet and draw it, whole or frame by frame |
| `show-a-loading-screen` | Wait for sprites and audio with `BT.loadingAssetsCount` |
| `add-text` | Scores, labels, and titles with the built-in or a bitmap font |
| `use-palette` | Set up colors as numbered palette slots |
| `animate-the-palette` | Cycle, fade, flash, and swap colors for motion and mood |
| `move-and-time` | The frame clock, timers, cooldowns, easing curves, and `interpolate` |
| `use-random` | Dice, picks, shuffles, weighted drops, and seeds that replay the same game |
| `use-noise` | Terrain, caves, clouds, and procedural textures from noise and coordinate hashing |
| `smooth-the-motion` | Make movement look smooth instead of stepped, with `BT.renderAlpha` |
| `scroll-with-camera` | Scroll a world bigger than the screen, clamped to its bounds |
| `read-keyboard` | Keys, face buttons, typed text, and remapping |
| `read-pointer` | Mouse, touch, and pen, up to four at once |
| `read-gamepad` | Controllers: buttons, sticks, and triggers |
| `play-a-sound` | Sound effects, music, volume, and why a game starts silent |
| `design-a-sound` | Build a custom sound from scratch when the presets are not right |
| `add-crt-effect` | Fullscreen post-process effects: CRT, scanlines, bloom, glitch (WebGPU only) |
| `show-debug-overlay` | FPS, timings, your own values, the palette grid, audio volume meters, and renderer diagnostics |
| `keep-it-fast` | The game stutters, drops frames, or sprites start vanishing |
| `save-a-screenshot` | Capture the frame as a PNG |
| `share-the-game` | Build it and put it online for other people to play |
| `migrate` | Update the game's code after a BLIT386 upgrade (renames + enable hot reload) |
