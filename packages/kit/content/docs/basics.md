# Basics: the game loop

Every BLIT386 game is one class with up to four methods. You hand the class to `bootstrap()` and the engine takes care
of the rest.

```js
import { bootstrap, BT, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

class Game {
  configure() {
    // Optional. Omit it to get a 320x240 screen at 60 frames per second.
    // Return settings to change the size or speed:
    return {
      displaySize: new Vector2i(320, 240), // the pixel grid you draw on
      targetFPS: 60, // how many times update/render run per second
      // preferredOrientation: 'landscape', // optional; ask phones to stay landscape
    };
  }

  async init() {
    // Runs once, at the start. Set up colors and load anything you need.
    // Return true when it worked.
    return true;
  }

  // Optional. Called when the phone rotates (type is a string like 'landscape-primary').
  // onOrientationChange(type) {}

  update() {
    // Runs ~60 times a second, before render(). Read input and change your game's state here.
    // Do NOT draw here.
  }

  render() {
    // Runs ~60 times a second, after update(). Draw the current picture here.
    // Do NOT change game logic here.
  }
}

bootstrap(Game);
```

## Why update and render are separate

- `update()` is the "thinking" step: where is the player, did they press a key, did two things collide.
- `render()` is the "drawing" step: put the current state on screen.

Keeping them apart keeps games predictable. Decide things in `update()`, draw them in `render()`.

## Telling time

The engine gives you a few read-only values (they are properties, so no parentheses):

- `BT.ticks` - how many update steps have happened since the start (a steadily rising whole number). Great for timers:
  `if (BT.ticks % 30 === 0) { ... }` does something twice a second.
- `BT.targetFPS` - the frames-per-second you asked for (default 60).
- `BT.deltaSeconds` - how much time one step represents, in seconds. Use it for smooth motion if you prefer
  speed-per-second over speed-per-step.

## Phones and screen orientation

`BT.screenOrientation` is the current orientation type from the browser (for example `'landscape-primary'`), or `null`
when the browser does not report one. Set `preferredOrientation: 'landscape'` or `'portrait'` in `configure()` if your
game assumes one layout - the engine asks the browser to lock after start when it can (often Android Chrome; not iOS
Safari). Optional `onOrientationChange(type)` on your game class runs when the player rotates the device. Drawing a
"please rotate" message is still your code; the engine only tells you the orientation.

## Respecting reduced motion (blit386 1.7.0+)

Some people turn on a system setting that asks apps for less movement - because heavy motion makes them dizzy or unwell.
`BT.isReducedMotionPreferred` is `true` when they have (a property, no parentheses):

```js
async init() {
    this.shakeAmount = BT.isReducedMotionPreferred ? 0 : 4;
    return true;
}

// Optional. The engine calls this if the setting changes while the game is running.
onReducedMotionChange(prefersReduced) {
    this.shakeAmount = prefersReduced ? 0 : 4;
}
```

Read it once in `init()` for the starting value, and add `onReducedMotionChange(prefersReduced)` to your game class if
you want to react mid-session. The BLIT386 splash already tones itself down on its own, but the engine never changes
your drawing for you. Screen shake, flashing, and long swooping transitions are the things worth toning down; the game
itself moving is fine.

## Drawing between two steps

`update()` runs at a fixed speed (60 times a second), but the screen often draws faster than that - 120 or 144 times a
second on a modern monitor. That means some drawn frames land _in between_ two thinking steps.

`BT.renderAlpha` tells you where you landed: `0` is "exactly on the previous step", `1` is "exactly on the current
step", `0.5` is "halfway between them". If you ignore it and just draw the current position, motion looks slightly
stepped. If you use it, motion looks smooth.

To use it, remember where a thing was before you move it:

```js
import { BT, Rect2i, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

update() {
    this.prevPos = this.pos.clone(); // remember, BEFORE moving
    this.pos = this.pos.add(this.vel);
}

render() {
    const drawPos = Vector2i.lerp(this.prevPos, this.pos, BT.renderAlpha);
    BT.drawRectFill(new Rect2i(drawPos.x, drawPos.y, 8, 8), 2);
}
```

Do this for things that move. Do not do it for the HUD or the score - those should sit still.

## init returns a promise

`init()` is `async`, which means it can wait for things to load. Anything that loads (a font, a sprite sheet) gives back
a promise, so you must `await` it:

```js
async init() {
    this.font = await SomeLoader.load('...'); // await is required
    return true;
}
```

Forgetting `await` is the single most common beginner mistake. If something you loaded is `undefined`, check for a
missing `await` first.

## Waiting for assets (a loading screen)

`BT.loadingAssetsCount` is how many image and audio loads are still in flight. It is a property (no parentheses). To
draw a "Loading…" message, return from `init()` before every load finishes (start loads in a helper you do not await
from `init()`), then poll the counter in `update()` / `render()`:

```js
if (BT.loadingAssetsCount > 0) {
  BT.systemPrint(new Vector2i(8, 8), 1, 'Loading...');
  return;
}
```

If you `await` every load inside `init()`, the loop has not started yet, so there is nothing to draw on - that is fine
for small games. Per-sheet hot-reload replacements also expose `sheet.status` (`'loading' | 'ready' | 'failed'`) and a
coarse `sheet.progress` (`0` or `1.0`). Prefer `BT.loadingAssetsCount` for one engine-wide signal.

## The splash

A short BLIT386 splash plays before your game starts. A real build shows it by default; running `npx blit run` (or
`npm run dev`) is a development build, which skips it by default. To check it, build and preview:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

While the splash is up, your `init()` is already running - the splash doubles as a loading screen and holds until
`init()` finishes, however long that takes. So if the splash is playing, awaiting your loads inside `init()` costs the
player nothing. Any key, click, or tap skips the fade-in and the waiting, but it still waits for your `init()` to
finish, and the fade into your game's colors always plays in full. That press is swallowed, so your first `update()`
does not see it.

One thing to know: the splash owns the screen colors while it plays. Your `BT.paletteSet()` inside `init()` is held and
applied when the splash finishes, fading up out of black. Palette _effects_ you start inside `init()` are dropped, so
start those from your first `update()` instead.

Turn it off in `configure()`:

```js
configure() {
    return { isSplashEnabled: false };
}
```

Or skip it once by adding `?nosplash` to the URL. `?splash` forces it on, which is how you check it in a dev build.

## Keep playing while you edit

New projects include the `blit386` Vite plugin, so most saves keep the running game alive. Optional
`onHotReload(context)` on your game class can restore fields after an `init()` edit. Full detail: `docs/hot-reload.md`.

Next: `docs/drawing.md` to put things on screen, `docs/input.md` to react to the player, `docs/palette.md` for colors,
`docs/random.md` for dice rolls and generated worlds.
