# Getting started

This is everything you need to go from a fresh computer to a running game.

## 1. Install Node.js (one time)

Your computer needs a free program called Node.js. It runs your game's code on your machine. You only install it once.

1. Go to nodejs.org and download the button marked LTS (it means "the stable one").
2. Install it like any other app: keep clicking Next or Continue.
3. Quit and reopen your editor so it notices the new program.

## 2. Open a terminal

A terminal is a place to type commands. Most editors have one built in:

- Zed: open the bottom panel, or use the menu to show the terminal.
- VS Code / Cursor: the menu has "Terminal".

Make sure the terminal is sitting in your game's folder (the one with `package.json` in it).

## 3. Install the game's parts

Type this and press Enter. It downloads the BLIT386 engine. Wait for it to finish.

```bash
npm install
```

## 4. Run the game

```bash
npm run dev
```

It prints a web address like `http://localhost:5173`. Hold Cmd (or Ctrl on Windows) and click it, or paste it into your
browser. Your game is running. Leave the terminal open while you play.

You can also type `npx blit run`, which does the same thing in a friendlier way. The `npx` part means "run the helper
that is installed inside this project" - typing plain `blit` would not work, because the helper lives in your game's
folder, not on your whole computer.

## 5. Change something

Open `src/game.js` (or `src/game.ts` if you chose TypeScript). Find a number or a color and change it. Save the file.
The browser updates by itself - and with the starter's `blit386` Vite plugin, most code edits keep the game running
(score and position stay put) instead of wiping everything with a full page reload. Change a PNG or sound under
`public/` and that asset updates in place too. That is the whole loop: change a little, look, repeat.

More detail: `docs/hot-reload.md`.

## If something seems wrong

Run `npx blit doctor`. It checks your Node version, whether your work is saved with git, and which version of BLIT386
you have, then tells you what to do in plain language.

If the game itself misbehaves - a blank screen, red errors, a change that did something strange - open
`when-something-breaks.md` in this folder. It walks through the most common problems one by one.
