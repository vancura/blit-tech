# Fix a runtime error

Diagnose and fix a BLIT386 game error using the local docs.

## When to use

Use when the game crashes, shows a blank screen, throws an error in the browser console, or behaves unexpectedly.

## Steps

1. Open `docs/when-something-breaks.md` first. It covers the most common beginner errors with concrete fixes.
2. On a blank screen: ensure `BT.paletteSet(palette)` was called in `init()` before any draw call.
3. If you see "Cannot read properties of undefined": you likely forgot `await` before sprite or font load calls.
4. Note: 0 is not a valid palette index - slot 0 is always transparent; use slot 1 or higher.
5. Check `AGENTS.md` for correct engine API usage - getters have no `()`, methods do.
6. Post-process effects require WebGPU - confirm `BT.activeBackend` is not `'software'` (the Canvas 2D fallback does not
   run effects). Keep starters free of post-process effects.

## What to check

- `update()` is for logic only; `render()` is for drawing only. Drawing in `update()` causes visual glitches.
- If key or button taps feel randomly missed: `isKeyPressed`/`isKeyReleased`/`inputString`/`isPressed`/`isReleased` must
  be read in `update()`. Reading them in `render()` can miss the one-frame edge; see `docs/input.md`.
- All screen coordinates must be whole numbers (`Vector2i`, `Rect2i`). Fractions cause off-by-one pixel issues.
- If you see `{{` or `}}` in a file, a template placeholder was not substituted - this is a scaffolding bug, not a game
  bug.
- After a save that breaks `init()`, hot reload should leave the previous game running - fix the typo and save again
  (see `docs/hot-reload.md`). If every tiny edit full-reloads the page, confirm `vite.config.js` has
  `plugins: [blit386()]` and blit386 is 1.4.0+.
