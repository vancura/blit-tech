# Structure a game

BLIT386 draws pixels, reads input, and plays sound. It does NOT include physics, collision, enemies, or a scene system -
you write that game logic yourself. This skill shows the shape to put it in.

## When to use

Use when starting a new game, or when the user asks "how do I add a player / collision / enemies" and might expect
built-in systems. Set the expectation early: the engine draws, reads input, and plays sound; you build the game logic.

## The shape of a game

```js
import { bootstrap, BT, Color32, Rect2i, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

class Game {
  // configure() {}            // optional; omit for a 320x240 screen at 60 FPS
  async init() {
    // load assets and set up colors once; return true on success
    this.player = new Rect2i(150, 110, 16, 16);
    return true;
  }
  update() {
    // YOUR logic: read input, move things, check collisions, change state
  }
  render() {
    // draw the current state; do not change logic here
  }
}

bootstrap(Game);
```

## You build these yourself

- Movement: change your own numbers in `update()`. The engine never moves anything for you.
- Collision: there is no physics. Test overlap yourself with `Rect2i.isIntersecting(other)`.
- Restart: reset your own variables. `BT.ticksReset()` zeroes the frame counter if you time things off `BT.ticks`.

```js
if (this.player.isIntersecting(this.coin)) {
  this.score += 1;
}
```

## The engine does provide these

- Drawing: shapes, sprites, text, and the palette.
- Input: keyboard, pointer, and gamepad.
- Sound: a bus mixer, loadable clips, looping music, and a synth that builds retro sounds from nothing (see the
  play-a-sound skill).

## Notes

- `update()` decides; `render()` draws. Keep them apart (see `docs/basics.md`).
- The engine runs on WebGPU and falls back to plain Canvas 2D, so a game always renders. Only fullscreen post-process
  effects need WebGPU (see the add-crt-effect skill); sound works on both.
- Optional `onHotReload(context)` can restore fields after an `init()` edit while the Vite plugin keeps the session
  alive - see the use-hot-reload skill and `docs/hot-reload.md`.

See `docs/basics.md`.
