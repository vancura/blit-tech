# Share the game

`{{pmRunDev}}` runs the game on your own computer while you make it. To let other people play, you make a "production
build" - a folder of plain files - and upload that folder to a free hosting site. The game is just files, so there is no
server or database to set up.

## When to use

Use when the user wants to publish, deploy, or host the game, send a playable link to a friend, or asks "how do I put my
game online" or "make a real version".

## Step 1: build the game

```sh
{{pmRunBuild}}
```

This writes a `dist/` folder. Everything the game needs is inside it: the HTML page, the JavaScript, and your sprites
and fonts. That whole folder _is_ the game.

## Step 2: try the built game before sharing

The built game can behave a little differently from the dev server, so test it once first. Your project has a `preview`
script for this - run it the same way you run `dev` and `build` (for example `pnpm run preview` or `npm run preview`).
It serves the `dist/` folder at a local web address so you can click around and confirm everything still works.

## Step 3: put dist/ online

Upload the whole `dist/` folder to any free static host - it accepts plain files, no server needed. Good options for a
game are GitHub Pages, Netlify, Cloudflare Pages, or itch.io (drag-and-drop the folder). Each one gives you back a web
address you can share.

## Notes

- The game runs on WebGPU where it is available and falls back to plain Canvas 2D everywhere else, so friends can play
  in any modern browser with nothing extra installed. (Only fullscreen CRT or post-process effects need WebGPU - see the
  add-crt-effect skill.)
- Has sound? Expect the shared game to be silent until the player clicks, taps, or presses a key. Browsers refuse to
  make noise on a page nobody has touched yet, so this is not a broken upload. Give the game a "press a key to start"
  screen and the sound arrives with the first keypress. See the play-a-sound skill.
- Played on a phone? Mobile browsers dim and then lock the screen after 30-60 seconds of no touches, even mid-game. Set
  `isWakeLockEnabled: true` in `configure()` to keep the screen awake during active play. Landscape-only games can also
  set `preferredOrientation: 'landscape'` (Android may lock; iOS will not) and read `BT.screenOrientation` or implement
  `onOrientationChange(type)` to show a "please rotate" prompt. See the blit-api-names rule for the exact names.
- Made a change you want to share? Run `{{pmRunBuild}}` again and re-upload `dist/`. The build does not update itself.
- Do not hand-edit files inside `dist/` - they are generated from your `src/` code. Change the source, then rebuild.
