# Run the game

Start the BLIT386 dev server and open the game in a browser.

## When to use

Use this when you need to run the game to test a change, or when the user says "run the game", "start the server", or
"show me what this looks like."

## Steps

1. In the project folder, run `{{pmRunDev}}` (or `npx blit run`).
2. The browser opens automatically at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next free port).
3. Edit and save - with the starter's `blit386` Vite plugin, most code and `public/` asset edits keep the game running
   (hot reload) instead of wiping state. Full detail: `docs/hot-reload.md`. There is no need to restart the server after
   each edit.
4. To stop the server: press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal.

## Notes

- If the port is in use, read `docs/when-something-breaks.md` for the "port already in use" fix.
- If the browser does not open, navigate to `http://localhost:5173` manually.
- The game works without WebGPU (the engine falls back to Canvas 2D), so it runs in any modern browser.
- Older project, and every save full-reloads the page? Run `npx blit migrate --write` (blit386 1.4.0+) to wire the
  plugin into `vite.config`, then restart once.
