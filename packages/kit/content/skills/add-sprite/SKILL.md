# Add a sprite

Load a PNG sprite sheet, put its colors into the palette, and draw pieces of it.

## When to use

Use when the user wants an image, character, or tile on screen instead of plain shapes.

## How to do it

Load in `init()` (it is async, so `await` it). `loadIndexed` does the whole setup in one call:

```js
async init() {
    this.palette = BT.paletteCreate(64);

    // Loads the PNG, registers its colors into the palette starting at slot 1,
    // and links the sheet to those slots. Returns the sheet plus a full-frame srcRect.
    const result = await SpriteSheet.loadIndexed('/sprites/hero.png', this.palette, 1);
    this.hero = result.sheet;
    this.heroRect = result.srcRect; // the whole image

    BT.paletteSet(this.palette);
    return true;
}

render() {
    BT.clear(0);
    // sheet, source rectangle (which part of the sheet), destination top-left
    BT.drawSprite(this.hero, this.heroRect, new Vector2i(120, 90));
}
```

Draw one frame from a sheet by passing a smaller source rectangle:

```js
const frame = new Rect2i(this.frameIndex * 16, 0, 16, 16); // 16x16 frames in a row
BT.drawSprite(this.hero, frame, new Vector2i(120, 90));
```

## Key calls

- `SpriteSheet.loadIndexed(url, palette, startSlot, options?)` (static, async) - returns `{ sheet, srcRect, colors }`.
- `BT.drawSprite(sheet, srcRect, destPos, paletteOffset?)` (method) - draw a region. `paletteOffset` shifts every
  pixel's slot, so you can recolor the same sprite (team colors, day/night).
- `sheet.fullRect()` (method) - the whole-sheet `Rect2i`.

## Notes

- Slot 0 is transparent, so sprite colors start at slot 1. `loadIndexed` handles that.
- Sprites draw at whole-number positions only.
- There is no built-in flip or rotate at draw time yet - the `FLIP_*` / `ROT_*` constants are not accepted by
  `drawSprite` today. To face the other way, author a flipped frame in the PNG.
- Editing a PNG under `public/` while `npm run dev` is running hot-replaces the sheet in place (blit386 1.4.0+ with the
  Vite plugin). If the image size changed, recompute any `srcRect` you cached. For a loading UI, see the
  show-a-loading-screen skill (`BT.loadingAssetsCount`, `sheet.status`, `sheet.progress`).

See `docs/drawing.md`.
