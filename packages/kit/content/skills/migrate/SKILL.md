# Update BLIT386 API names

Update a game after a BLIT386 upgrade renamed parts of the API: let `blit migrate` make the safe renames, then handle
the rest by hand.

## When to use

Use when `blit upgrade` or `blit migrate` reports names that "need a closer look," when the game breaks after a BLIT386
update, or when the user says "update my game to the new version" or "fix the renamed functions."

## Steps

1. Preview first: run `npx blit migrate`. It lists the renames it can make automatically, the ones that need review, and
   whether it can enable hot reload in `vite.config` (blit386 1.4.0+). Nothing is written yet.
2. Apply the safe ones: run `npx blit migrate --write`. This rewrites unambiguous names for you (for example
   `BT.buttonDown` -> `BT.isDown`, the `overlayEnabled` config flag -> `isOverlayEnabled`) and, when missing, adds the
   `blit386()` Vite plugin so code and `public/` asset edits keep the game running.
3. Handle each "needs a closer look" item by hand. These are common words, so the tool will not rewrite them blindly -
   they might belong to your own code. Only rename a call when the value on the left is the matching BLIT386 type:
   - `.equals(...)` -> `.isEqual(...)` on a `Vector2i`, `Rect2i`, or `Color32`
   - `.contains(...)` -> `.isContaining(...)` on a `Rect2i`
   - `.intersects(...)` -> `.isIntersecting(...)` on a `Rect2i`
   - `.tick(...)` -> `.fireIfElapsed(...)` on a `Timer`
   - Inside the `bootstrap(...)` options object only: `canvasId` -> `canvasID`, `containerId` -> `containerID`,
     `waitForDOMReady` -> `isWaitingForDOMReady`
4. Leave anything that is not a BLIT386 value alone. A plain array's `.contains(...)` or your own `tick()` method is not
   the engine - do not touch it.
5. If migrate could not edit an unusual `vite.config`, add hot reload by hand (see the use-hot-reload skill /
   `docs/hot-reload.md`), then restart `npx blit run` once.
6. Verify: run `npx blit run` and play the game, or `npx blit doctor` to check the setup. If something still breaks, use
   the "fix" skill.

## Notes

- The full, authoritative list of old -> new names is the engine's deprecation timeline:
  https://blit386.dev/docs/reference/deprecations
- Hot reload enablement needs blit386 1.4.0+. Prefer `npx blit upgrade` first if you are behind - it updates the engine
  and then offers the same migrate step.
- `blit migrate` previews by default and only changes files with `--write`, so it is always safe to run and read first.
- If the project is not saved with git, save a copy before writing - `blit migrate --write` warns about this first.
