/**
 * Benchmarks for {@link GameLoop}'s dropped-frame detection scan.
 *
 * `detectFrameDrop` is private and only reachable in production through the
 * rAF-driven `tick()` chain, so this file uses the same narrow type-cast
 * technique as `GameLoop.test.ts` to invoke it directly - see that file's
 * `frame-drop detection` describe block. Casting straight to the private
 * method (rather than driving it through `tick()`) keeps the measurement
 * limited to the O(60) min-scan itself, without `tick()`'s unrelated
 * accumulator/update/render bookkeeping mixed in.
