/**
 * The BLIT386 splash: a logo bitmap fading in, holding, and fading out on its
 * own gray ramp before the game's first frame.
 *
 * Owns its palette, its own {@link PaletteEffectManager}, and its own state
 * machine. It does *not* own the frame driver - `BTAPI.init()` calls
 * {@link Splash.advance} and {@link Splash.draw} from a `requestAnimationFrame`
 * loop that runs before the `GameLoop` is constructed. Keeping the loop outside
 * this class is what makes the state machine testable with a fake clock and
 * keeps the fixed-timestep accumulator from ever seeing splash time.
 *
 * No engine code outside this subsystem may branch on `fadingIn` / `fadingOut`.
 * The moment it does, the animation model becomes public API forever - which is
 * why {@link Splash.isVisible} is computed here rather than by the caller.
