/**
 * The splash's own palette: a 16-step ramp between two configurable endpoints.
 *
 * Steps are spaced evenly in encoded 8-bit sRGB channel values - the numbers an
 * image editor reports - so an artist's mid-gray lands on the nearest step to the
 * value they drew it as. (Even in encoded sRGB is close to, but not the same as,
 * even in perceived lightness; the point here is predictable quantization of the
 * values the artwork is authored in.) An earlier version
 * spaced them evenly in linear light instead; that put the first step at encoded
 * 73 and left no slot at all below it, so shadow detail authored in an image
 * editor either jumped several steps brighter or crushed to black.
 *
 * This costs the fades nothing. `ExposureFadeEffect` converts to linear light
 * itself, per channel, on whatever colors the palette holds - so the in-camera
 * behavior of the fade is independent of how the static steps are distributed.
 * The two concerns only looked coupled.
