/**
 * Lifecycle state of the BLIT386 splash.

 * `disabled` and `done` are indistinguishable to every consumer outside the
 * engine - both mean "not on screen, never will be again" - which is why
 * {@link BT.isSplashVisible} exists as the derived one-term query.
 *
 * With the splash disabled, `disabled` is the only value game code ever reads.
 * With it enabled, an `init()` observes `fadingIn` and, if it lives long enough,
 * `shown`; its first `update()` after handoff reads `done`. `fadingOut` is
 * engine-internal - `update()` and `render()` are suspended for the splash's
 * whole duration, so nothing outside the engine runs while it is current.
