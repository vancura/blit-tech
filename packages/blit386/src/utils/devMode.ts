/**
 * Engine-level dev vs. release mode detection.
 *
 * `import.meta.env.DEV` cannot be used - the engine ships both ESM and CJS, and
 * the engine is pre-built into `dist` before a consumer's bundler ever sees it,
 * so a bundler `define` cannot reach this module either. The only signal that
 * survives being pre-built is a runtime global, assigned by the `blit386/vite`
 * plugin's injected snippet (see `src/vite/transform.ts`).
 *
 * Split into a pure resolver ({@link resolveDevMode}) and a thin reader
 * ({@link isDevMode}) so the precedence logic is unit-testable in the default
 * Node vitest environment, with no `happy-dom` opt-in - BT-416 depends on that
 * property holding.
 *
 * This is UX/DX gating, not DRM: any consumer can flip `globalThis.__BLIT386_DEV__`
 * by hand, and that is fine.
