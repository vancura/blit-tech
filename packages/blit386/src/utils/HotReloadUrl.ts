 * appended past a fragment is invalid URL syntax and browsers treat it as part of the
 * fragment, so the parameter would never actually reach the server.
 *
 * The busted URL is only ever used for the actual `fetch`/`Image.src` request -
 * callers keep caching the result under the original, un-busted `url`.

 * @returns `url` with a `blit386-hmr=<timestamp>` query parameter inserted before any fragment.
