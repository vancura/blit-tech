/**
 * Decoded audio asset backed by a Web Audio `AudioBuffer`.
 *
 * `AudioClip` is responsible for:
 * - streaming a download over `fetch`, reporting byte-accurate progress when
 *   the response carries a `Content-Length`
 * - decoding the downloaded bytes against the engine's registered decode
 *   `AudioContext` (see `audioDecodeContext.ts`)
 * - caching resolved clips by their winning source URL and deduplicating
 *   concurrent requests for the same URL
 * - falling back through an ordered list of candidate URLs so a caller can
 *   offer alternate containers/codecs for browsers that cannot decode the
 *   first choice
 * - synthesizing a clip procedurally via {@link AudioClip.synth}, entirely on the CPU with no
 *   source file, no `OfflineAudioContext`, and no URL cache entry
 *
 * Playback (voices, buses) lives in the audio subsystem (`VoicePool` / `MusicPlayer` /
 * `AudioManager`, reached through `BT.soundPlay` / `BT.musicPlay`); this class only covers
 * loading, caching, releasing, and synthesizing decoded buffers.
