# Developer Experience Guide

This guide covers the contributing workflow, code style conventions, IDE setup, and maintenance checklists for the
BLIT386 project.

---

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full contributor workflow. Key points:

- Fork the repository and create a feature branch from `main`.
- Use Node.js >=22.18.0 and pnpm 11.20.0+ (see `engines` and `packageManager` in `package.json`).
- Run `pnpm install` and confirm `pnpm run preflight` passes before opening a PR.
- All commits require a DCO sign-off: use `git commit -s`.
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages.
- Open a pull request against `main`. CI must be green before merge.

| `pnpm run test:security-preflight` | Unit tests for MCP preflight script |

`docs:links` and `agents:check` are repo-wide: each package's copy walks the whole tree from the repo root no matter
which `package.json` invoked it. They are deliberately absent from every package's `preflight` chain so that one push
does not run the same full-repo check two to four times - run them once from the repo root instead
(`pnpm run docs:links`, `pnpm run agents:check`), as `.husky/pre-push` does after the per-package gates pass.

Dependency audit severity policy and CI gate: [dependency-policy.md](security/dependency-policy.md). Temporary
exceptions: [audit-exceptions.md](security/audit-exceptions.md).

## Code style

Formatting:

- 4-space indent, 120-character line width
- Single quotes, always semicolons, always trailing commas
- Biome formats TypeScript/JavaScript; Prettier formats Markdown/YAML
- Run `pnpm run format` to auto-format; `pnpm run format:check` to verify

Linting:

- ESLint with perfectionist, jsdoc, security, and promise plugins
- `perfectionist/sort-classes` enforces class member order (see File structure and member order); `simple-import-sort`
  enforces import/export order
- `pnpm run lint` to check; `pnpm run lint:fix` to auto-fix

Naming conventions:

- Public API methods: camelCase
- Types and classes: PascalCase
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` for module-level; camelCase for local
- Named exports only; no default exports
- JSDoc required for all public API members
- Internal scoped naming: private fields, private methods, protected members, and module-local constants/types must not
  repeat the class or file name (context already scopes them). Examples: `FrameCapture.request()` not
  `requestCapture()`; `FRAGMENT_WGSL` in `Bloom.ts` not `BLOOM_FRAGMENT_WGSL`; file-local `Serialized` in `Palette.ts`
  not `PaletteJSON` or `JSON`. Does not apply to `BT.*`, barrel exports, or public class methods. JSDoc that points at
  public API uses full public names (`BT.BTN_POINTER_A`, not shortened internal aliases). See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)
  (Internal scoped naming).
- `BT` getters vs. methods: zero-argument read-only snapshots are getters (`BT.displaySize.y`); actions, parameterized
  queries, and async work are methods (`BT.cameraSet`, `BT.pointerPos(0)`). Full rules: [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (BT
  API: getters vs. methods).
- `BT` getter names that surface `configure()` / `HardwareSettings` use the same field names (`displaySize`,
  `targetFPS`, `drawingBufferSize`, …). `BT.outputSize` is derived (`drawingBufferSize ?? displaySize`), not a configure
  field. Keep acronym spelling consistent (`targetFPS`, not `targetFps`). Runtime-only reads use descriptive names
  (`activeBackend`, `requestedBackend`, `ticks`, `deltaSeconds`). Use `activeBackend` for runtime capability checks;
  `requestedBackend` mirrors resolved `HardwareSettings.backend` (including `?backend=software`).

Boolean naming (three tiers):

| Tier | Use | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A Runtime read-only queries | `is*` / `has*` | `isPointerActive`, `isIndexed`, `hasGlyph`, `isDirty` |
| B `HardwareSettings` / `BootstrapOptions` | grammatical `is*` | `isOverlayEnabled`, `isDetectingDroppedFrames` |
| C Side effects / operation results | imperative verbs, not `is*` | `fireIfElapsed()`, `intersectTo(other, out): boolean`, `remove(): boolean` |

- Use `-ing` for configure flags that enable ongoing behavior (`isDetectingDroppedFrames`, not `isDetectDroppedFrames`).
- Hold vs. edge on `BT`: `isDown` / `isKeyDown` (held), `isPressed` / `isReleased` (button masks), `isKeyPressed` /
  `isKeyReleased` (keyboard codes). Internal input classes use the same names (`PointerInput.isButtonDown`,
  `KeyboardInput.isKeyDown`, `GamepadInput.isButtonDown`). Do not embed a second `Is` in the identifier (`isKeyPressed`
  \- grep: `\bis[A-Za-z]+Is[A-Z]`).
- Identifier acronyms use both capitals: `canvasID`, `containerID` (not `canvasId`).

File structure and member order:

Class member order is enforced by `perfectionist/sort-classes` (and import order by `simple-import-sort`); run
`pnpm run lint:fix` to auto-fix. The rule uses `type: 'unsorted'`, so it enforces only the group order below and
preserves the hand-tuned order within each group (logical method families stay as written). Match this layout when
adding or moving code. Never use `// #region` / `// #endregion` - region markers are banned.

- File layout (top to bottom): module JSDoc → imports (`import type`, sorted) → leading module members (config/input
  constants, validators, lookup tables, type aliases) → the primary class/interface/function → trailing module members
  (WGSL / template-literal constants such as `FRAGMENT_WGSL`, and pure helper functions placed after the class; exported
  helpers before private ones).
- Class member order: (1) static fields (cached singletons, registries); (2) instance fields, public → protected →
  private, `readonly` grouped, one JSDoc + blank line per field; (3) constructor (parameter-properties carry inline
  JSDoc); (4) accessors - static getters, then instance getters/setters; (5) static methods, public before private; (6)
  instance methods, public → protected → private, private helpers last.
- Cross-cutting: keep a deprecated alias next to its canonical member (`equals` after `isEqual`); cluster method
  families (new-allocating → `*To` zero-alloc → `*InPlace` → queries → `clone`/`toString`); one blank line between
  members and before `return`; JSDoc on every member including private. See [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (TypeScript file
  structure).

## IDE setup

### Zed

`.zed/settings.json` is committed to the repository - clone the repo and it applies automatically. It mirrors the repo
toolchain: Biome (via its Zed extension/language server) formats TS/JS/JSON on save, Prettier (built in) formats
Markdown/YAML on save, and `agent.tool_permissions` blocks the built-in agent from editing lock files or `.env` files
(mirroring the `PreToolUse` file-block hook in `.claude/settings.json`).

### Claude Code

Claude Code reads agent policy from this repo's `.claude/` directory, plus the project MCP servers declared in the root
`.mcp.json`.

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/rules/*.md` | Agent rules - always-applied global policy plus glob-scoped rules (for example `ts-file-structure.md` on `src/**/*.ts`) |
| `.claude/settings.json` | Hooks: `SessionStart` → toolchain bootstrap; `PreToolUse` → RTK shell rewrite + sensitive-file block; `PostToolUse` → format + spellcheck |
| `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Reusable command workflows (`preflight`, `format`, …); Zed symlinks under `.agents/skills/` |
| `.mcp.json` | Project MCP servers - `blit386-docs`, the blit386.dev docs server (`search_docs`, `get_docs_summary`). Listed as a pre-approved project server in `.claude/settings.json`, so it connects without a per-machine trust prompt |

When changing `package.json` scripts or preflight steps, update matching `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files and any
`.claude/rules/*.md` that reference those commands.

### Cursor

Cursor reads `AGENTS.md` (root and every package) natively, independently of `.cursor/rules/` – so most policy content
that used to need a `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` mirror doesn't need one anymore. `.cursor/` carries only what has no AGENTS.md
equivalent:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | Mirrors only the rule files still standalone in root `.claude/rules/` (currently `docs-sync-required.mdc`, `named-constants.mdc`) – `alwaysApply: false` with `globs:` scoping, same policy as their `.claude/rules/*.md` counterparts |
| `.cursor/hooks.json` | Hooks: `preToolUse` → RTK shell rewrite; `afterFileEdit` → format on save; `beforeShellExecution` → git safety. No `sessionStart` hook – `packages/kit/content/hooks.manifest.json` (the current source of truth for what hooks a blit386 project needs) defines one for Claude only |
| `.cursor/hooks/format-and-check.sh` | Post-edit Biome (TS/JS/JSON/CSS) + Prettier (MD/MDX/MDC/YAML) on the touched file, matching `.claude/settings.json`'s `PostToolUse` hook |
| `.cursor/hooks/shell-safety.sh` | Symlink to `packages/kit/content/hooks/shell-safety.sh` – the same dual-protocol (Cursor + Claude) hook every scaffolded game gets, reused directly rather than hand-maintained twice |
| `.cursor/commands/*.md` | Slash-command equivalents of the `.claude/skills/*` skills; generated by `scripts/sync-cursor-commands.mjs`, never hand-edited |
| `.cursor/mcp.json` | The `blit386-docs` MCP server, in Cursor's own schema (no `type` field – Cursor reserves that for local stdio servers, unlike the root `.mcp.json`'s Claude-only `"type": "http"`) |

`scripts/sync-cursor-commands.mjs` generates one `.cursor/commands/<name>.md` per `.claude/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`,
stripping the YAML frontmatter (Claude reads `name`/`description` from it to discover the skill; a Cursor command is
invoked by filename, so the frontmatter would otherwise render as literal text) – the same transform `@blit386/kit`'s
`generateCursorAdapter` applies for scaffolded projects. Run `pnpm run sync:cursor-commands` after adding, renaming, or
removing a `.claude/skills/*` skill; `pnpm run sync:cursor-commands:check` reports drift (wired into the `quality-root`
CI job and lint-staged) and a retired skill's stale command file is removed automatically.

## Dependency management

Renovate is configured (`renovate.json` at the project root). Dependency update PRs open automatically each Monday
before 6 AM:

- Patch updates and GitHub Actions updates: auto-merge after 7 days (`minimumReleaseAge`, aligned with `.npmrc`
  `minimum-release-age`)
- Minor updates: manual review required
- Major updates: manual review with `major-update` label
- Vulnerability alerts are enabled
- GitHub Actions stay digest-pinned (SHA plus trailing `# vN` comment) via `helpers:pinGitHubActionDigests`
- Renovate commits use a lowercase subject (`commitMessageAction: "update"`) and the `:gitSignOff` preset so they pass
  commitlint and the DCO check

Dependabot remains enabled for security-only updates; Renovate owns version and Actions bumps. See
[dependency-policy.md](security/dependency-policy.md#renovate-vs-dependabot).

CI workflows pin third-party actions by commit SHA (not `@vN` tags). See
[dependency-policy.md](security/dependency-policy.md#github-actions-pinning) for bumping SHAs and job permissions.

### Declaration tooling (TypeScript / API Extractor)

Public `.d.ts` output is produced by `vite-plugin-dts` with `rollupTypes: true`, which runs API Extractor during
`pnpm run build`. API Extractor currently ships against TypeScript 5.9.3, so the workspace pins the same version in
`package.json` (not TypeScript 6.x) to avoid compiler drift warnings and keep declaration analysis deterministic.

Watch builds skip declaration emit entirely. Under `vite build --watch` (or its `-w` shorthand) the dts plugin is left
out of the config: API Extractor's rollup crashes on every rebuild after the first, and nothing consumes declarations
mid-watch anyway. A watch build also leaves `dist` un-emptied, so the rolled-up `dist/blit386.d.ts` from the preceding
full `pnpm run build` stays in place - stale against in-flight source edits, but still the real published shape. Run a
one-shot `pnpm run build` to refresh it.

When bumping `typescript` or `vite-plugin-dts`, confirm `pnpm run build` logs no TS/API Extractor version mismatch and
that `dist/blit386.d.ts` still rolls up cleanly. Re-run `pnpm run typecheck` after any TypeScript line change; TS 5.9
stricter WebGPU typings may require small test/production fixes (for example `ArrayBuffer`-backed uniform buffers).

CI guard: the `build-engine` job runs `node scripts/check-declaration-tooling.mjs` on the `pnpm run build` log after
each build. It fails on known drift-warning patterns and verifies the API Extractor bundled TypeScript version matches
`package.json`. Locally: `pnpm run build` then `node scripts/check-declaration-tooling.mjs build.log`, or run
`pnpm run test:declarations` for the checker unit tests.

## Maintenance checklist

### Weekly

- [ ] Review and merge Renovate PRs
- [ ] Check open issues and respond
- [ ] Review open PRs
- [ ] Update the project board (if using)

### Monthly

- [ ] Review analytics/usage (if available)
- [ ] Update roadmap
- [ ] Check for security advisories
- [ ] MCP governance audit runs automatically (`.github/workflows/mcp-governance-audit.yml`, monthly); check it passed,
      or run it early (`pnpm run security:mcp-preflight -- --governance-only`; see
      [docs/security/security-runbook.md](security/security-runbook.md))
- [ ] Re-auth critical security MCPs (Opsera) if needed
- [ ] Review and close stale issues

### Before releases

- [ ] Run a full test suite
- [ ] Bump version
- [ ] Test library build
- [ ] Test examples deployment
- [ ] Create a GitHub release with notes
- [ ] Publish `blit386` to npm (`pnpm run release` or `pnpm publish --access public` after `pnpm run build`)
- [ ] Verify package page and install flow: https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386 and `npm install blit386`

npm provenance is not enabled: publishing is local-only today. `pnpm publish --provenance` needs an OIDC-backed CI
publish job; see [dependency-policy.md](security/dependency-policy.md#npm-publish-provenance).

- [ ] Announce on socials/discussions

### Quarterly

- [ ] Review and update documentation
- [ ] Evaluate new WebGPU features
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Dependency audit and cleanup
- [ ] Review contribution guidelines
- [ ] Update examples with new features
