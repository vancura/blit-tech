Bus volume, mute, and the browser autoplay-unlock state. For the higher-level subsystem walkthrough (bus graph layout,
locked vs. unlocked, and web autoplay constraints), see the [Audio Guide](guide-audio.md).

The audio graph has three buses: `'sfx'` and `'music'` feed into `'main'`, which feeds the browser's audio destination.
All three are independently controllable.

```text
sfx    ─┐
music  ─┼─► main ─► destination
```

`AudioBus` is the type of a bus name:

<Since symbol="AudioBus" />

```ts twoslash
import { type AudioBus } from 'blit386';
// ---cut---
declare const bus: AudioBus; // 'main' | 'music' | 'sfx'
```

## Volume

<Since symbol="BT.audioVolumeSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.audioVolumeGet" />

`BT.audioVolumeSet` sets a bus's volume, optionally fading to it. `BT.audioVolumeGet` reads it back.

```ts twoslash
import { BT } from 'blit386';
// ---cut---
BT.audioVolumeSet('music', 0.5); // immediate change
BT.audioVolumeSet('sfx', 0, { fadeMs: 300 }); // linear fade to silence over 300 ms
BT.audioVolumeSet('main', 0.8, { fadeMs: 500, easing: 'ease-out' }); // eased fade

BT.audioVolumeGet('music'); // 0.5
```

`options` fields:

<TypeTable type={{
    fadeMs: { type: 'number', description: 'Fade duration in milliseconds. Omit for an immediate change.' },
    easing: { type: 'EasingFunction', default: "'linear'", description: 'Easing curve for the fade. Ignored when fadeMs is omitted.' },
  }} />

With no `fadeMs`, the bus gain changes immediately. With `fadeMs`, `'linear'` easing schedules a linear ramp; any other
[easing curve](api-easing.md) is sampled into a value curve so the fade follows that curve rather than a straight line.

## Mute

<Since symbol="BT.audioMuteSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.isAudioMuted" />

`BT.audioMuteSet` mutes or unmutes a bus without touching its configured volume. `BT.isAudioMuted` reports the current
mute state.

```ts twoslash
import { BT } from 'blit386';
// ---cut---
BT.audioVolumeSet('music', 0.75);

BT.audioMuteSet('music', true); // silences the bus immediately (no fade)
BT.isAudioMuted('music'); // true
BT.audioVolumeGet('music'); // still 0.75 - muting never overwrites the configured level

BT.audioMuteSet('music', false); // restores audio at 0.75
```

`BT.audioVolumeGet` always returns the logical (pre-mute) volume, so reading it while muted still reports the level you
configured, not `0`.

<DemoEmbed demo="038-audio-buses" title="BLIT386 audio buses demo" />

## Unlock state

<Since symbol="BT.isAudioUnlocked" />

Browsers block audio playback until a user gesture. `BT.isAudioUnlocked` is `false` until the first `pointerdown`,
`keydown`, or `touchstart` on the canvas successfully resumes the audio context, and stays `true` for the rest of the
session.

```ts twoslash
import { BT } from 'blit386';
// ---cut---
if (!BT.isAudioUnlocked) {
  // Show a "click or press a key to enable audio" prompt.
}
```

See [Web audio constraints](guide-audio.md#web-audio-constraints) for what happens to volume/mute calls made before the
gesture, and why no configure flag can skip this requirement.

## Loading

<Since symbol="AudioClip" />

`AudioClip` decodes an audio file into a reusable `AudioBuffer`, exposing the winning source URL, duration, and sample
rate. Loading and decoding work even while the audio context is locked (suspended, pre-gesture) - only real-time
playback needs an unlocked context. See [Preloading audio clips](guide-audio.md#preloading-audio-clips).

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip } from 'blit386';

// Load a single clip (cached by its resolved URL)
const theme = await AudioClip.load('audio/theme.mp3');

// Fallback list: tries each URL in order, resolving with the first that decodes
const hit = await AudioClip.load(['audio/hit.ogg', 'audio/hit.mp3']);

// Load multiple clips in parallel - each entry is a single URL or a fallback list
const clips = await AudioClip.loadAll(['audio/theme.mp3', ['audio/hit.ogg', 'audio/hit.mp3']]);

// Check cache before loading
if (AudioClip.isLoaded('audio/theme.mp3')) {
  // already cached
}

// Number of clip loads currently in flight
AudioClip.loadingCount;
```

For a single loading-screen signal that also covers sprite sheet images, see
[`BT.loadingAssetsCount`](api-assets.md#loading-assets).

Pass `onProgress` to report phased load progress:

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip } from 'blit386';
// ---cut---
await AudioClip.load('audio/theme.mp3', {
  onProgress: (progress) => {
    console.log(progress.phase, progress.ratio);
  },
});
```

<TypeTable type={{
    phase: { type: "'download' | 'decoding'", description: 'Which stage of the load this snapshot reports.' },
    ratio: { type: 'number | null', description: 'Fraction complete in [0, 1]. null when Content-Length is unknown, or during the single, atomic decode step.' },
  }} />

Release a clip's decoded buffer with `unload()` once you no longer need it:

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip } from 'blit386';
declare const theme: AudioClip;
// ---cut---
theme.unload(); // releases the decoded buffer; safe to call more than once
```

- `AudioClip.load()` and `loadAll()` throw a beginner-friendly error covering network/CORS failures, HTTP status errors,
  unsupported container/codec decode failures, and loading before the engine has started.
- Prefer a fallback list (for example `['theme.ogg', 'theme.mp3']`) for any clip whose primary format might not decode
  in every browser - see [Audio formats](api-browser-support.md#audio-formats).
- Playing a loaded clip back as SFX is covered in [Playback (SFX)](#playback-sfx) below; as looping, crossfading music
  in [Playback (Music)](#playback-music).

Under a Vite dev server with the `blit386/vite` plugin installed, editing an audio file under a watched asset directory
(`public/` by default) swaps the decoded buffer inside the same `AudioClip` instance - demo-held references stay valid.
Any SFX voice still playing the old buffer is stopped; if the replaced clip is the currently playing music track,
playback restarts immediately (`fadeMs: 0`, no crossfade). `duration`/`sampleRate` reflect the buffer decoded at initial
load and are not updated by a hot reload. See [Hot Reload](guide-hot-reload.md#asset-hot-replace-matrix) for the full
asset type matrix.

## Synth

<Since symbol="SynthParams" />

`AudioClip.synth` renders a clip procedurally from a `SynthParams` descriptor - no source file, no network request, and
no `OfflineAudioContext`. Rendering runs entirely on the CPU and is deterministic: identical params (including `seed`)
always produce identical sample data, so a `SynthParams` object can be stored and replayed as a preset. Unlike
[Loading](#loading), there is nothing to fetch or decode from the network - a synthesized clip is ready the instant
`synth()` resolves, even before `BT.isAudioUnlocked` is `true` (see [Unlock state](#unlock-state) above).

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip } from 'blit386';

const laser = await AudioClip.synth({
  waveform: 'sawtooth',
  frequency: 880,
  duration: 0.3,
  pitchSweep: { toFrequency: 110 },
  seed: 1,
});
```

`SynthParams` fields:

<TypeTable type={{
    waveform: { type: "'sine' | 'square' | 'triangle' | 'sawtooth' | 'noise'", description: 'Oscillator waveform shape.' },
    frequency: { type: 'number', description: 'Base carrier frequency in Hz at the start of the clip.' },
    duration: { type: 'number', description: 'Total clip duration in seconds. Must be greater than 0 and no more than 60.' },
    volume: { type: 'number', default: '1', description: 'Overall output amplitude in [0, 1]; final output is always clamped.' },
    envelope: { type: 'SynthEnvelope', description: 'Attack/decay/sustain/release envelope.' },
    pitchSweep: { type: 'SynthPitchSweep', description: 'Linear pitch sweep from frequency to a target frequency.' },
    vibrato: { type: 'SynthVibrato', description: 'Sine-wave vibrato applied on top of frequency.' },
    noiseMix: { type: 'number', default: '0', description: 'Fraction of white noise mixed into the oscillator, in [0, 1]. Ignored when waveform is noise.' },
    dutyCycle: { type: 'number', default: '0.5', description: 'Fraction of each cycle spent high, in [0, 1]. Only affects square.' },
    seed: { type: 'number', description: 'Seed for the deterministic PRNG driving noise generation.' },
  }} />

<Since symbol="SynthEnvelope" />

`SynthEnvelope` fields (all optional, times in seconds):

<TypeTable type={{
    attack: { type: 'number', default: '0.01', description: 'Time to ramp from silence to full amplitude.' },
    decay: { type: 'number', default: '0.1', description: 'Time to fall from full amplitude to sustain.' },
    sustain: { type: 'number', default: '0.7', description: 'Gain level in [0, 1] held between decay and release.' },
    release: { type: 'number', default: '0.1', description: 'Time to fall from sustain to silence, anchored to the end of the clip.' },
  }} />

The release phase always finishes exactly at `duration`, even on a very short clip where the attack, decay, and release
phases overlap - a percussive hit is never cut off mid-fade.

<Since symbol="SynthPitchSweep" />

`SynthPitchSweep` fields:

<TypeTable type={{
    toFrequency: { type: 'number', description: 'Frequency in Hz the carrier linearly reaches by the end of the clip. Required, and must be greater than 0.' },
  }} />

<Since symbol="SynthVibrato" />

`SynthVibrato` fields (both optional):

<TypeTable type={{
    rate: { type: 'number', default: '5', description: 'Vibrato rate in Hz (oscillations per second). Must not be negative.' },
    depth: { type: 'number', default: '0', description: 'Peak frequency deviation in Hz above and below the carrier. Defaults to 0, so vibrato is silent until you set a depth. Must not be negative.' },
  }} />

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

// A short, noisy boom: mostly noise, with a touch of low square tone, quick attack and decay.
const boom = await AudioClip.synth({
  waveform: 'square',
  frequency: 90,
  duration: 0.4,
  noiseMix: 0.8,
  envelope: { attack: 0, decay: 0.05, sustain: 0.3, release: 0.3 },
  seed: 42,
});

BT.soundPlay(boom, { volume: 0.7 });
```

<Callout title="Not cached, not deduplicated">

Unlike `AudioClip.load()`, `AudioClip.synth()` never populates the URL-keyed resolved cache and never deduplicates
concurrent calls - every call renders a fresh, independent `AudioBuffer`, even for byte-identical `params`. `unload()`
still works the same way (releases the buffer, stops any voice playing it), it just has no cache entry to clear.

</Callout>

### Presets

<Since symbol="BT.synthPreset" />

`BT.synthPreset` bundles six ready-made `SynthParams` factories for common sound effects: `jump`, `pickup`, `explosion`,
`laser`, `hit`, `blip`. Each takes an optional `seed` and applies small, bounded, deterministic jitter to a couple of
hand-picked fields (frequency, duration, or noise mix) - the same seed always renders the exact same variant, so a
preset stays reproducible even though it varies from call to call.

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

// Same character every time - useful for a UI sound that should stay consistent.
const menuBlip = await AudioClip.synth(BT.synthPreset.blip());

// A different seed per pickup keeps repeated collects from sounding robotic, while staying
// reproducible - a wall-clock seed like Date.now() would defeat that, since it can never be
// replayed the same way twice.
let pickupCount = 0;
const coin = await AudioClip.synth(BT.synthPreset.pickup(pickupCount++));

BT.soundPlay(menuBlip);
BT.soundPlay(coin, { volume: 0.8 });
```

Omitting `seed` (or passing `0`) always renders the same baseline variant - useful when you want a preset's default
character rather than per-play variation. See [Playback (SFX)](#playback-sfx) below for playing the resulting clip
through the SFX voice pool, and [Design a sound](guide-audio.md#design-a-sound) in the Audio Guide for a walkthrough of
tuning `SynthParams` by hand and storing presets as data.

<DemoEmbed demo="041-synth-toy" title="BLIT386 synth toy demo" />

## Playback (SFX)

<Since symbol="BT.soundPlay" />
<Since symbol="SoundRef" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundStop" />
<Since symbol="BT.isSoundPlaying" />

`BT.soundPlay` plays a loaded `AudioClip` through a fixed-size pool of SFX voices. Each call returns an opaque
`SoundRef` handle - pass it to `BT.soundStop` and the per-sound volume, pitch, and pan controls.

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const hit = await AudioClip.load('audio/hit.mp3');

const ref = BT.soundPlay(hit, { volume: 0.8 });

BT.isSoundPlaying(ref); // true

BT.soundStop(ref, { fadeOutMs: 200 }); // fades out over 200 ms
```

<Since symbol="SoundPlayOptions" />

`options` fields:

<TypeTable type={{
    loop: { type: 'boolean', default: 'false', description: 'Whether the clip loops.' },
    volume: { type: 'number', default: '1', description: 'Initial gain in [0, 1] (unclamped).' },
    pitch: { type: 'number', default: '1', description: 'Initial playback rate.' },
    pan: { type: 'number', default: '0', description: 'Initial stereo pan in [-1, 1] (unclamped).' },
    priority: { type: 'number', default: '0', description: 'Allocation priority; higher survives voice stealing longer.' },
    fadeInMs: { type: 'number', description: 'Linear fade-in duration in milliseconds, from silence to volume.' },
    atTime: { type: 'number', description: 'Audio-clock start time. Defaults to "now".' },
  }} />

<Callout title="Voice cap and stealing">

`HardwareSettings.audioVoices` (default `16`) sizes a fixed pool of voices - it never grows. When every voice is in use,
a new `BT.soundPlay` call steals the lowest-priority active voice at or below the incoming priority (ties broken by
whichever voice started first). If every active voice outranks the incoming priority, the new sound is dropped silently:
no throw, and the returned `SoundRef` is inert (`BT.isSoundPlaying` reports `false` for it immediately).

Set `isOverlayAudioMetersEnabled: true` to see active/total voices, steal count, and drop count live in the overlay
instead of reasoning about the pool from code - see [Audio meters](api-overlay.md#audio-meters-optional).

</Callout>

A common pattern - vary pitch slightly per play so a repeated sound (footsteps, hits) doesn't sound robotic:

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const footstep = await AudioClip.load('audio/footstep.mp3');

function playFootstep() {
  const pitch = 0.9 + Math.random() * 0.2; // 0.9-1.1x

  BT.soundPlay(footstep, { pitch, volume: 0.6 });
}
```

<Since symbol="BT.soundVolumeSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundVolumeGet" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundPitchSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundPitchGet" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundPanSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.soundPanGet" />

Per-sound controls, all silent no-ops on a stale or invalid `SoundRef` (already stopped, stolen, or completed - never
throws):

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const hit = await AudioClip.load('audio/hit.mp3');
const ref = BT.soundPlay(hit);
// ---cut---
BT.soundVolumeSet(ref, 0.5, { fadeMs: 100 });
BT.soundVolumeGet(ref); // 0.5

BT.soundPitchSet(ref, 1.2);
BT.soundPitchGet(ref); // 1.2

BT.soundPanSet(ref, -0.3);
BT.soundPanGet(ref); // -0.3
```

`BT.soundPlay` also returns an inert `SoundRef` (no throw) when `clip` hasn't finished loading yet, or was already
released with `clip.unload()`.

<DemoEmbed demo="036-audio-basics" title="BLIT386 audio basics demo" />

## Playback (Music)

<Since symbol="BT.musicPlay" />
<Since symbol="BT.musicStop" />
<Since symbol="BT.isMusicPlaying" />

`BT.musicPlay` plays a loaded `AudioClip` through a single looping music player, distinct from the SFX voice pool -
there is no `SoundRef` to manage, and calling it again crossfades from whatever is currently playing into the new track
rather than layering the two.

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const theme = await AudioClip.load('audio/theme.mp3');

BT.musicPlay(theme, { volume: 0.8 });

BT.isMusicPlaying; // true

BT.musicStop({ fadeMs: 500 }); // fades out over 500 ms
```

<Since symbol="MusicPlayOptions" />

`options` fields:

<TypeTable type={{
    volume: { type: 'number', default: '1', description: 'Target gain for the incoming track in [0, 1] (unclamped).' },
    fadeMs: { type: 'number', default: '0', description: 'Crossfade duration in milliseconds, applied to both the outgoing fade-out and the incoming fade-in. 0 switches immediately.' },
    overlap: { type: 'number', default: '1', description: 'Crossfade timing offset in [-1, 1]. See Crossfading below.' },
    easeIn: { type: 'EasingFunction', default: "'linear'", description: "Easing curve for the incoming track's fade-in." },
    easeOut: { type: 'EasingFunction', default: "'linear'", description: "Easing curve for the outgoing track's fade-out." },
    loop: { type: 'boolean', default: 'true', description: 'Whether the whole track loops. Ignored when loopStart/loopEnd are given.' },
    loopStart: { type: 'number', description: 'Loop region start in seconds. Requires loopEnd.' },
    loopEnd: { type: 'number', description: 'Loop region end in seconds. Requires loopStart.' },
  }} />

### Crossfading

`fadeMs` sets how long each side of a crossfade takes; `overlap` sets how the two sides line up in time:

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const calm = await AudioClip.load('audio/calm.mp3');
const battle = await AudioClip.load('audio/battle.mp3');

BT.musicPlay(calm);

// Later, when the fight starts:
BT.musicPlay(battle, { fadeMs: 800, overlap: 1 }); // calm fades out while battle fades in, at the same time
BT.musicPlay(battle, { fadeMs: 800, overlap: 0 }); // battle starts fading in exactly as calm finishes fading out
BT.musicPlay(battle, { fadeMs: 800, overlap: -1 }); // an 800 ms silence gap between the two
```

Calling `BT.musicPlay` again before a crossfade finishes immediately cuts the track that was already fading out - only
one crossfade is ever in flight, so rapid calls (menu navigation, quick scene changes) never pile up.

### Loop points

Loop the whole track (the default), a one-shot, or a specific region such as a bridge that repeats while an intro plays
only once:

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const theme = await AudioClip.load('audio/theme.mp3');

BT.musicPlay(theme); // loops the whole track (default)
BT.musicPlay(theme, { loop: false }); // plays once and stops
BT.musicPlay(theme, { loopStart: 8, loopEnd: 32 }); // an 8s intro, then loops the 8-32s region forever
```

`loopStart` and `loopEnd` must be given together, with `0 <= loopStart < loopEnd <= duration` - `BT.musicPlay` throws a
beginner-friendly error otherwise, since a mismatched pair is always a programmer mistake rather than something that can
happen from normal play.

<Since symbol="BT.musicVolumeSet" />
<Since symbol="BT.musicVolumeGet" />

`BT.musicVolumeSet` sets the current track's gain, optionally fading to it; `BT.musicVolumeGet` reads back the last
requested target (not a mid-fade instantaneous value):

```ts twoslash
import { AudioClip, BT } from 'blit386';

const theme = await AudioClip.load('audio/theme.mp3');
BT.musicPlay(theme);
// ---cut---
BT.musicVolumeSet(0.4, { fadeMs: 300 });
BT.musicVolumeGet(); // 0.4
```

<Callout title="Remembered while locked, not dropped">

Unlike `BT.soundPlay`, a `BT.musicPlay` call made before `BT.isAudioUnlocked` is `true` is not dropped - the engine
remembers the most recent pending request and starts it automatically the instant the context unlocks. Calling
`BT.musicPlay` again while still locked replaces the remembered request; only the latest survives to unlock.

</Callout>

`BT.musicPlay` silently does nothing (no throw) when `clip` hasn't finished loading yet, or was already released with
`clip.unload()` - the same as `BT.soundPlay`.

See [Playing music](guide-audio.md#playing-music) in the Audio Guide for a state-based music switching pattern and an
intro-then-loop recipe.
