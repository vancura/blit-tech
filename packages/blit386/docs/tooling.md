# Tooling

Build, declaration, and quality-tooling notes for contributors. For the full contributing workflow and IDE setup, see
[Developer Experience Guide](developer-experience-guide.md).

## TypeScript version

The workspace pins TypeScript 5.9.3 in `package.json` to match the compiler bundled with API Extractor (invoked by
`vite-plugin-dts` when `rollupTypes: true`). This avoids TS/API Extractor drift warnings during `pnpm run build` and
keeps rolled-up `dist/blit386.d.ts` deterministic.

Only non-watch builds emit declarations at all: `vite build --watch` (or `-w`) drops the dts plugin, because API
Extractor's rollup crashes on every rebuild after the first. Run the checker against a `dist` from a full
`pnpm run build`, never one a watch session left behind.

When bumping `typescript` or `vite-plugin-dts`, confirm the build log reports the same bundled version and that
`node scripts/check-declaration-tooling.mjs build.log` passes (log alignment plus required `BT` getters in
`dist/blit386.d.ts`, including `requestedBackend` and `activeBackend`). See
[Declaration tooling](developer-experience-guide.md#declaration-tooling-typescript--api-extractor) in the DX guide for
CI details.

## Declaration tooling commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm run test:declarations` | Node tests for `scripts/check-declaration-tooling.mjs` (drift patterns and alignment log parsing). Included in `pnpm run preflight`. |
| `pnpm run build` then `node scripts/check-declaration-tooling.mjs build.log` | Manual check after a local build (same assertion CI runs). |

CI runs the checker after `pnpm run build` in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - the `build-engine` job. `bundle-size` does
not repeat it: that job downloads `build-engine`'s `dist/` artifact rather than rebuilding, so the check has already run
by the time it starts.
