`HotContext`, `registerHotReload`, `HotReloadContext`, and `IBTDemo.onHotReload` live in
[API: Core](api-core.md#hot-reload). This guide covers the dev-loop hot reload enabled by the plugin, the three swap
tiers with worked examples, the asset hot-replace matrix, and the `blit386/vite` plugin that wires it all up.

## What hot reload replaces

Without it, every saved change to a demo or game source file triggers a full page reload: the whole module graph
re-evaluates, `bootstrap()` runs cold again, and every piece of runtime state is lost - the player's position, score,
current level, whatever was on screen. Editing an asset under `public/` (a sprite, a sound, a font) does nothing at all;
the running instance keeps using whatever it already loaded.

With the `blit386/vite` plugin installed, both of those become live updates instead. A code change injects new behavior
into the already-running demo, preserving as much state as the change allows. An asset change replaces the
already-loaded resource in place. A page reload still happens, but only for the handful of changes that are genuinely
incompatible with swapping in place - see [What always forces a full reload](#what-always-forces-a-full-reload) below.

This is engine-side infrastructure. Nothing about it requires demo code to change - `onHotReload` is optional, and a
demo that never implements it still gets prototype swaps and re-inits for free. It only affects local development;
`import.meta.hot` never exists outside a Vite dev server, so every part of this is a no-op in a production build.

## The three tiers

`bootstrap()` decides which tier applies by comparing the newly re-evaluated demo class against the one currently
running, every time Vite's HMR boundary re-evaluates the entry module. The decision is entirely mechanical - it is not
configurable, and there is no way to force a different tier from demo code.

### Tier 1: method-only change

If the constructor, class field initializers, and `init()` are all unchanged (compared by source text), the running
instance's prototype is swapped onto the new class. Every field on the instance is left exactly as it was - `init()`
does not re-run, music keeps playing, and the game loop keeps ticking without a hitch.

```ts twoslash
import { BT, type IBTDemo, Rect2i, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

const SPEED = 120; // change this number and save - the running instance picks it up immediately

class Demo implements IBTDemo {
  private pos = new Vector2i(0, 0);

  async init() {
    return true;
  }

  update() {
    this.pos = new Vector2i(this.pos.x + SPEED * BT.deltaSeconds, this.pos.y);
  }

  render() {
    BT.drawRectFill(new Rect2i(this.pos.x, this.pos.y, 16, 16), 1);
  }
}
```

Editing `update()`, `render()`, or the module-level `SPEED` constant only changes method bodies - `init()` and the
constructor are untouched, so this is a Tier 1 swap. `this.pos` keeps whatever value it already had; the sprite does not
jump back to the origin.

The `SPEED` case is the detail worth understanding: a Tier 1 swap does not touch `this.pos`, but it does replace
`update` with a brand new function, freshly defined in the newly re-evaluated module. That new function closes over the
new module's top-level scope - so the new value of `SPEED` takes effect on the very next tick, even though no field on
the instance changed. Module-level constants referenced from methods are effectively live-editable.

<Callout type="warn" title="A constant baked into an instance field by init() is not live-editable">
  The live-editable behavior above only holds while every reader of the constant is a method that runs fresh each
  tick. If `init()` also reads the same constant to build data cached in an instance field - filling a scene buffer,
  precomputing a lookup table, seeding a starting position - editing the constant is still a methods-only change as
  far as the fingerprint in [Tier 2](#tier-2-initconstructor-change) is concerned: `init()`'s own source text did not
  change, only the value an unrelated top-level `const` resolves to. So the swap stays Tier 1, `init()` does not
  re-run, and the instance field keeps whatever it was built from before the edit - while methods swapped in by the
  same save read the new value immediately. The two go out of sync until you force a Tier 2 path yourself (touch
  `init()`, the constructor, or a class field initializer) or fall back to a full page reload / dev server restart.
</Callout>

### Tier 2: init/constructor change

If `init()`, the constructor, or a class field initializer changed, a Tier 1 swap is not safe - the running instance was
built by code that no longer exists. Instead, a fresh instance is constructed and its `init()` runs while the previous
instance keeps driving the loop. Only once that succeeds does the engine swap the new instance in; a failed `init()`
(returns `false`, or throws) leaves the previous instance running untouched, so a broken save never crashes your game.

Just before the new instance's `init()` runs, the previous instance's own enumerable fields are captured into a
`snapshot` and handed to the new instance's `onHotReload`, so you can restore whatever state matters to you:

```ts twoslash
import { BT, type IBTDemo, type HotReloadContext, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

class Demo implements IBTDemo {
  private score = 0;
  private pos = new Vector2i(0, 0);

  async init() {
    // Editing this method (or the constructor, or a class field initializer)
    // changes the class's init fingerprint, so a save here takes the Tier 2 path.
    this.pos = new Vector2i(160, 120);

    return true;
  }

  onHotReload(context: HotReloadContext) {
    if (context.reason !== 'reinit' || !context.snapshot) {
      return;
    }

    // snapshot holds the previous instance's own enumerable fields, captured
    // right before this fresh instance's init() ran.
    if (typeof context.snapshot.score === 'number') {
      this.score = context.snapshot.score;
    }
    if (context.snapshot.pos instanceof Vector2i) {
      this.pos = context.snapshot.pos;
    }
  }

  update() {}

  render() {
    BT.systemPrint(new Vector2i(8, 8), 1, `score: ${this.score}`);
  }
}
```

Without the `onHotReload` hook, a Tier 2 swap still works - it just means every field resets to whatever `init()` sets
it to, same as a cold boot. Implementing `onHotReload` is how you opt into carrying state across a re-init.

### Tier 3: hardware settings change

If `configure()`'s return value differs from what is currently running - a different `displaySize`, backend, target
frame rate, or any other field listed in [Hardware settings](api-core.md#hardware-settings) - neither swap is safe. Some
of those changes mean recreating the canvas, the WebGPU device, or the audio graph, and there is no in-place path for
that. The engine requests a full page reload instead, through Vite's `import.meta.hot.invalidate()`.

```ts twoslash
import { type IBTDemo, type HardwareSettings, Vector2i } from 'blit386';

class Demo implements IBTDemo {
  configure(): Partial<HardwareSettings> {
    // Changing displaySize, drawingBufferSize, backend, targetFPS, audioVoices,
    // outputUpscaleFilter, maxCanvasSize, or any overlay flag forces a full page
    // reload on save - there is no partial-swap path for hardware settings.
    return { displaySize: new Vector2i(320, 240) };
  }

  async init() {
    return true;
  }

  update() {}
  render() {}
}
```

`onHotReload` never fires for a Tier 3 reload - the page is gone before there is anything left to notify.

Running under `?backend=software` does not itself force a Tier 3 reload on every edit. The comparison accounts for the
URL override on both sides, so only a genuine `configure()` change - not the override alone - triggers a full page
reload.

## The `blit386:hot-reload` DOM event

Every successful Tier 1 or Tier 2 swap also dispatches a `blit386:hot-reload` `CustomEvent` on the engine canvas
(falling back to `window` if the canvas does not exist yet). It bubbles and is composed, and its `detail` carries the
same `reason` and `generation` values passed to `onHotReload`:

```ts twoslash
declare const canvas: HTMLCanvasElement;
// ---cut---
canvas.addEventListener('blit386:hot-reload', (event) => {
  const { reason, generation } = (event as CustomEvent).detail;

  console.log(`hot reload #${generation} (${reason})`);
});
```

This is a DOM event rather than a second `BT` callback API on purpose: `onHotReload` is for the demo class itself to
react to its own state; the DOM event is for anything outside the demo class that wants to know a reload happened - a
browser extension, an in-page dev overlay, a Playwright test waiting for the swap to settle, or any other tooling that
has no reason to import `blit386` at all. It fires whether or not the demo implements `onHotReload`.

## Asset hot-replace matrix

The plugin also watches configured asset directories (`public/` by default) and broadcasts a `blit386:asset-changed` HMR
event for anything it recognizes. The engine routes that event by file type:

| Asset type | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Image (`.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`) | Every registered `SpriteSheet` built from that URL swaps its texture in place, re-running `indexize()` against the active palette when the sheet was already indexized. See the dimension-change caveat below. |
| Audio (`.wav`, `.mp3`, `.ogg`, `.flac`) | The same `AudioClip` instance swaps its decoded buffer in place - demo-held references stay valid. Any SFX voice still playing the old buffer is stopped; if the replaced clip is the currently playing music track, playback restarts immediately (`fadeMs: 0`, no crossfade). `duration`/`sampleRate` reflect the buffer decoded at initial load and are not updated. |
| Bitmap font (`.btfont`) | The same `BitmapFont` instance rebuilds its glyph tables and texture in place. `name`/`size`/`lineHeight`/`baseline` are frozen at their original values - only glyph data and the texture update. |
| Palette | Nothing hot-reload-specific needed - `BT.palette` is already a live reference, so mutating a slot with `palette.set()` takes effect on the very next frame regardless of how the change was triggered. |
| Anything else | Falls back to a full page reload (`fullReloadOnUnknownAssets`, default `true` - see [Plugin options](#plugin-options)). |

<Callout title="Demo-held srcRects and dimension changes">
  If a hot-replaced image has different dimensions than the one it replaced, the sprite sheet's `size` updates to
  match and its internal buffers rebuild accordingly - but any `Rect2i` a demo is holding onto as a `srcRect` into
  that sheet does not update itself. Reconciling a stale `srcRect` after a dimension change is the demo's own
  responsibility; keep sprite sheet dimensions stable during a hot-reload session, or recompute `srcRect`s from the
  sheet's current `width`/`height` in `onHotReload`.
</Callout>

You can also force a fresh load by hand with `AssetLoader.evict(url)` - it removes a URL's cached image (and any
in-flight load) so the next `loadImage()` call starts over. The automatic asset watcher does not call it; it fetches a
cache-busted copy directly. `evict` is there for cases the watcher does not cover, like a CDN-hosted image that changed
outside the watched directories. See [Loading assets](api-assets.md#loading-assets).

## What always forces a full reload

Beyond the Tier 3 hardware-settings case above, three other situations always mean a full page reload rather than a
swap:

- Editing the engine's own source (a `blit386` dist rebuild). The hot-reload boundary lives in the demo/game's entry
  module, not inside the engine bundle itself - a changed `blit386` dist is a different module identity as far as Vite's
  module graph is concerned, so there is nothing to swap into.
- An asset change with an unrecognized extension, when `fullReloadOnUnknownAssets` is left at its default `true`.
- Calling `bootstrap()` a second time with no Vite HMR context registered at all (for example, calling it twice by
  mistake outside of a dev server) logs an error and returns `false`, rather than silently starting a second,
  unstoppable game loop. Before 1.4.0, the same mistake silently started a second GameLoop.

This is a deliberate design choice, not a current limitation: a hard reload is always a full page reload, so there is
never a point in the engine's lifetime where a renderer needs to tear itself down and rebuild in place - the whole page,
canvas, and WebGPU device go away and come back fresh instead. That is why `IRenderer` has no `dispose` method. Adding
one would mean maintaining a teardown path that a real page reload already gives you for free.

## The `blit386/vite` plugin

Everything above only runs once the plugin is installed in your Vite config:

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { blit386 } from 'blit386/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [blit386()],
});
```

The plugin does three things, all dev-server only (`apply: 'serve'` - a production build never sees it, so there is zero
runtime cost or behavior change to ship):

- Appends a small hot-reload registration snippet to any served module that imports `blit386` and calls
  `bootstrap(...)`:

  ```js
  /* blit386:hot-reload-snippet */
  import { registerHotReload as __blit386_registerHotReload } from 'blit386';
  globalThis.__BLIT386_DEV__ = true;
  if (import.meta.hot) {
    import.meta.hot.accept();
    __blit386_registerHotReload(import.meta.hot);
  }
  ```

  `registerHotReload` is imported under a plugin-specific alias so the snippet cannot collide with an entry module that
  already binds `registerHotReload` itself (which would be a duplicate-declaration `SyntaxError`).

  The literal `import.meta.hot.accept()` call has to appear in the emitted source - Vite marks a module self-accepting
  by static analysis, so an indirect call would not register self-acceptance and every edit would fall back to a full
  reload regardless of which tier should have applied. You never write or call `registerHotReload` yourself; the plugin
  injects it, and the engine handles everything from there.

  For a plain `.js`/`.mjs` entry, the plugin also syntax-checks the module before injecting. Vite's own default
  transform pipeline excludes those extensions from server-side parsing, so without this a broken entry module would
  surface only as a silently caught client-side error - Vite's error overlay would never appear. A `.ts`/`.mts` entry is
  unaffected; it already gets real syntax validation from Vite's own transform.

- Marks the build as dev for [`BT.isDevMode`](api-core.md#dev-vs-release-mode) via the snippet's
  `globalThis.__BLIT386_DEV__ = true` line - a responsibility this plugin has beyond hot reload itself. It runs
  unconditionally, not only inside the `import.meta.hot` guard, because the snippet as a whole is only ever injected by
  this dev-server-only plugin. This is the standard, automatic signal `BT.isDevMode` looks for; the same snippet's
  `registerHotReload(import.meta.hot)` call also registers a live Vite HMR context, which `BT.isDevMode` checks as a
  late fallback (see [Dev vs. release mode](api-core.md#dev-vs-release-mode)). A consumer who skips this plugin gets
  neither signal, so `BT.isDevMode` reads as release. Because the snippet is appended after the rest of the entry
  module, a module-scope `BT.isDevMode` read (rather than one inside `update()`/`render()`) can still observe `false` in
  a dev build.

- Watches the configured asset directories and broadcasts `blit386:asset-changed` events for recognized file types (see
  the [asset matrix](#asset-hot-replace-matrix) above), falling back to a full reload for anything else.

### Plugin options

<TypeTable type={{
    include: {
      description: 'Predicate selecting which modules get the hot-reload snippet appended.',
      type: '(id: string) => boolean',
      default: "a module under /src/ ending .js, .ts, .mjs, or .mts",
    },
    assetDirs: {
      description: 'Directories to watch for asset changes, resolved against the Vite root.',
      type: 'string[]',
      default: "['public']",
    },
    assetTypes: {
      description: 'Maps a lowercased file extension (with leading dot) to an asset kind. Merged over, not replacing, the defaults.',
      type: "Record<string, 'image' | 'audio' | 'font' | 'other'>",
      default: '.png/.gif/.webp/.jpg/.jpeg -> image, .wav/.mp3/.ogg/.flac -> audio, .btfont -> font',
    },
    fullReloadOnUnknownAssets: {
      description: 'Whether an asset change with an unrecognized extension triggers a full page reload.',
      type: 'boolean',
      default: 'true',
    },
  }} />

A game that keeps level data or animation descriptors under `public/levels/` can watch that directory too, and treat
`.json` as its own asset kind (routed through the `'other'` fallback today, so this only changes what the console log
attributes the reload to until a dedicated handler exists):

```js
// vite.config.js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import { blit386 } from 'blit386/vite';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    blit386({
      assetDirs: ['public', 'public/levels'],
      assetTypes: { '.json': 'other' },
    }),
  ],
});
```

## Future ideas

Not implemented yet - notes for where this could go next:

- An overlay badge showing the current reload count and the last file that triggered it.
- A `?hardreload` query parameter or a keyboard chord that forces a clean Tier 2 re-init on demand, without waiting for
  a source edit.
- Live `.btfont` glyph-metric editing (today only the texture and glyph tables hot-reload; metrics come from the
  descriptor JSON, which does already reload - this is about interactively nudging metrics from a tool, not a gap in
  what already reloads).
- Hot-editing a palette file directly, rather than only palette slot mutations already being live.
- Resuming music at its previous playback position across a hot-reload restart, instead of restarting from the top.
- Persisting a demo's own state (via `sessionStorage` or similar) across a full page reload, so a Tier 3 change does not
  lose progress the way a Tier 1/2 swap preserves it.
- Verifying compatibility with StackBlitz/WebContainers. The plugin is built entirely on Vite's public dev-server plugin
  API with no Node-only assumptions beyond what any Vite plugin already requires, so this is expected to work, but it
  has not been verified hands-on yet.
