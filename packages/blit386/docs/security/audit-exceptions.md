# Audit exceptions playbook

Use this when a moderate or higher advisory cannot be remediated immediately and CI must stay green with explicit risk
acceptance.

## When to use

- Upstream has no patched release yet.
- A major toolchain bump is required and is scheduled on a tracked issue.
- `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` are insufficient and the only alternative is a documented temporary ignore.

Do not use exceptions for low-severity findings (CI does not gate on them).

## Process

1. Open a risk-acceptance issue using the
   [security risk acceptance template](../../../../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security-risk-acceptance.yml).
2. Link a remediation issue (Linear or GitHub) with an owner and target date.
3. Add the GHSA to the `security:audit` script in `package.json`:

   ```json
   "security:audit": "pnpm audit --audit-level=moderate --ignore GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
   ```

   Note: `package.json`'s `pnpm` field is not read at all under pnpm 11; use the `--ignore` CLI flag for a temporary,
   time-boxed exception, or `audit.ignore` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for a permanent one.

4. Record the exception in the table below (one row per GHSA).
5. Set a review-by date (default: 30 days; extend only with written rationale in the issue).
6. Remove on expiry - remove the `--ignore <GHSA>` flag from the `security:audit` script, clear the table row, and close
   the acceptance issue.

## Active exceptions

| GHSA | Package / path | Severity | Accepted | Review by | Remediation issue | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Technical notes

- Prefer `overrides` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and direct dependency upgrades over an ignore when a patched version
  exists.
- If `minimumReleaseAge` in [`pnpm-workspace.yaml`](../../../../pnpm-workspace.yaml) blocks a security patch, add the
  package to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in the same PR as the override and document why.
- `package.json`'s `pnpm` field is not read at all under pnpm 11. Use the `--ignore <GHSA>` flag in the `security:audit`
  script for a temporary exception, or `audit.ignore` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` for a permanent one.
- After any exception, still run `pnpm run security:audit:prod` - production dependencies must remain clean unless
  explicitly documented otherwise.
