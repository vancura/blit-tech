/**
 * Vitest covers `src/**` - the Fumapress `ServerPlugin`s that run in the deployed Worker.
 *
 * The `scripts/**` suite stays on `node --test` (see `test:scripts` in package.json): it is
 * plain `.mjs` with `node:assert`, it runs in under a second, and migrating it would be churn.
 * Two runners in one package is the same split `packages/blit386` already uses.
 *
 * Plain Vitest rather than `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` - see `CLAUDE.md`, "Test runners",
 * for the trade-off and the accepted fidelity gap.
