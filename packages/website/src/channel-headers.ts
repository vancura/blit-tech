/**
 * Marks every response `noindex` on the `next.blit386.dev` preview channel, and serves a
 * disallow-all `/robots.txt` there instead of the production `public/robots.txt` asset.
 *
 * Reads `c.env.BLIT386_CHANNEL` at request time, the same way `markdown-negotiation.ts` reads
 * `c.env.ASSETS` - NOT a build-time `process.env.BLIT386_CHANNEL` constant. This module's top
 * level re-runs inside the deployed Worker on every cold start (to reconstruct the Fumapress
 * plugin list), and the Worker has no access to the CI build step's shell env, only to whatever
 * `wrangler.json` declares as `vars` (injected by `scripts/patch-wrangler.mjs` when
 * `BLIT386_CHANNEL=next`), surfaced via `c.env`.
 *
 * Must run before `markdownNegotiationPlugin` in the `.plugins()` chain: that plugin's
 * assets-first fallback serves the static `public/robots.txt` directly and returns without
 * calling `next()`, so a plugin registered after it would never see a `/robots.txt` request in
 * order to override it, and would never get a chance to set a header on any other asset
 * response either.
