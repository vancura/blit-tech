/**
 * Allows the site's inline scripts by a per-request nonce, so `script-src` never needs

 *
 * The site renders statically (`mode: 'static'` in `press.config.tsx`), so its HTML is a build
 * artifact: Waku's React bootstrap script and the RSC flight payload `rsc-html-stream` injects are
 * both per-page, no fixed hash list can cover them, and Waku's own `unstable_setNonce` only applies
 * to request-time SSR. That leaves the Worker as the only place a nonce can be applied.
 *
 * This wraps the server entry's `fetch` rather than contributing a middleware, because a Fumapress
 * `ServerPlugin` middleware never sees the response it would need to rewrite. Fumapress runs plugin
 * middlewares through its own composer (`fumapress/dist/router/index.js`, `pluginsMiddleware`), which
 * keeps a downstream handler's returned `Response` in a local and returns it at the end - it never
 * assigns `c.res`. So after `await next()`, `c.res` is still Hono's placeholder, and only its
 * *headers* survive, merged onto the real response by Hono's `set res`. That is enough for
 * `channelHeadersPlugin`'s `x-robots-tag`, and not enough here: stamping needs the body.
 *
 * The server entry is the outermost hook, and its `fetch` is called with `(request, env, ...)` -
 * which is also where the `BLIT386_CSP_REPORT_ONLY` var arrives, the same request-time binding read
 * `channelHeadersPlugin` documents for `BLIT386_CHANNEL`.
