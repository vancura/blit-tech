/**
 * The site's Content-Security-Policy, defined once.
 *
 * Two surfaces serve this policy and they must not drift apart:
 *
 * - `public/_headers` applies {@link BASE_CSP} to every response Cloudflare serves from the ASSETS
 *   binding - images, fonts, `.md` routes, JSON. It is the fail-closed default.
 * - `src/csp-nonce.ts` replaces that header on prerendered HTML with `buildCsp(nonce)`, whose
 *   `script-src` carries a fresh per-request nonce.
 *
 * `public/_headers` is a static file that cannot import anything, so its CSP line is a hand-written
 * copy of {@link BASE_CSP}. `csp.test.ts` reads the file and asserts the two are character-identical,
 * which is what makes the copy safe (see `.claude/rules/named-constants.md`).
 *
 * Why a nonce rather than hashes: the site is prerendered (`mode: 'static'` in `press.config.tsx`),
 * and Waku's React bootstrap script plus the RSC flight payload that `rsc-html-stream` injects are
 * both per-page, so no fixed hash list can cover them. Waku's own `unstable_setNonce` is
 * request-time SSR only and does nothing under static rendering, hence the Worker-side stamping.
 *
 * Deliberately no `'strict-dynamic'`: every chunk this site loads is same-origin and already covered
 * by `'self'`, while `'strict-dynamic'` would void both `'self'` and the `https://plausible.io`
 * allowance. Worth revisiting only if third-party scripts ever start loading further scripts.

 *
 * Load-bearing entries that must not be tightened (see `CLAUDE.md`, "Blog media"): `media-src 'self'`
 * for the self-hosted blog clips, and `frame-src https://demos.blit386.dev` for embedded demos.
 * `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` remains - Fumadocs and Tailwind both emit inline styles, and removing it
 * is a separate piece of work from BT-191.
