// Reduced Motion: a warp starfield that damps itself when the viewer asks for less motion.
// @description A warp starfield whose speed, streaks, shake, and blinking all damp for reduced motion.
//
// Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
//
// Prerequisites:
//   Basics    https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
//   Starfield https://demos.blit386.dev/starfield
//
// Guide: https://blit386.dev/docs/api/core#reduced-motion
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE
// A cockpit window looking straight down the flight path. Stars drift out from the
// middle of the screen, and every few seconds the ship jumps to warp: the stars speed
// up, stretch into long streaks, the hull kicks sideways, and a lamp starts blinking.
// Then it drops back out and the cycle repeats.
//
// Some people get dizzy, nauseated, or a headache from exactly this kind of motion.
// Every desktop and phone has a system setting for it - macOS calls it "Reduce motion",
// Windows calls it "Animation effects", iOS and Android have their own switches - and
// the browser passes that choice to us. When it is on, this demo keeps flying but takes
// the edge off: slower stars, no streaks, no shake, and a lamp that stays lit instead of
// blinking. It never freezes, because a frozen screen reads as a crash.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
//   - BT.isReducedMotionPreferred: the viewer's current answer, read once at startup
//   - onReducedMotionChange(): the engine tells you when that answer changes, live
//   - Perspective: dividing by depth turns a flat list of points into a 3D tunnel
//   - Deriving a streak from speed, so one number controls both looks
//   - Screen shake as a camera offset, and why the camera must be reset before the UI
//   - Degrading motion instead of deleting it: slower, shorter, steadier - not stopped
//
// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM THE STARFIELD DEMO
// https://demos.blit386.dev/starfield fakes depth: three flat layers scrolling sideways
// at three speeds. This demo computes depth instead. Each star has a real distance, and
// the screen position is worked out by dividing by it, so a star speeds up all on its own
// as it gets closer. Nobody wrote that acceleration - it falls out of the division.
//
// HOW TO TRY IT
//   - Press M (or tap the checkbox) to force reduced motion on without touching your OS.
//   - Press J (or tap the button) to jump to warp or drop back out right now.
//   - Turn your system's reduce-motion setting on or off while this page is open and
//     watch the "Hook fired" counter climb. No reload needed.
//   - Add ?reducedmotion or ?noreducedmotion to the address to start in either state.
//     Careful: a URL flag pins the answer, so the change hook stays quiet while it is on.
//
// The engine's own startup splash follows the same preference by itself - it holds a
// still frame instead of dissolving: https://blit386.dev/docs/guides/splash#reduced-motion
