// @pageTitle BLIT386 Demo – Music Playback
// @description Crossfade two looping tracks with different fade profiles, plus a third with a seamless loop point.

/**
 * Music Demo - crossfading between two tracks and playing one with a seamless loop point.
 *
 * Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
 * Prerequisites:
 *   Audio Basics  https://demos.blit386.dev/audio-basics
 *
 * Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/music
 *
 * Sound effects (audio-basics, synth-toy) are short one-shot clips: press a key, hear a blip, done. Music
 * is different - it is meant to loop forever in the background, and switching from one
 * track to another should not just cut off with a click. BT.musicPlay() handles both of
 * those jobs for you.
 *
 * This page has three buttons, each backed by a different AudioClip:
 * - Track A and Track B swap between two looping tunes. Each swap uses a different
 *   "crossfade" - a fade-out of the old track happening alongside (or after) a fade-in of
 *   the new one, so the music blends instead of jumping. Switching to Track A lets the old
 *   track fade all the way out first, waits a moment, then fades Track A in. Switching to
 *   Track B overlaps the two fades so they happen at the same time. Listen for the
 *   difference - one has a small silent gap in the middle, the other does not.
 * - Loop Demo plays a track that starts with a short intro passage, then loops forever from
 *   a chosen point onward - the intro only ever plays once, exactly like the opening jingle
 *   of a real game level that then settles into its main tune.
 *
 * The title strip, track buttons, and status readout all come from the shared UI kit in
 * src/shared/ui.js - the same look every demo in this series uses, and it is fully
 * touch-friendly: tap a button with a finger, click it with a mouse, or press its number
 * key, and the kit reports all three the same way.
 *
 * Click or press a key to unlock sound first (see Audio Basics for why browsers require
 * that first click).
