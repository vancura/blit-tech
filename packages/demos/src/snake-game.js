/**
 * Snake - grid snake with walls, food, keyboard steering, and PipBoy CRT post-processing.
 * @description Grid snake with walls, food, keyboard, D-pad, and swipe steering, plus PipBoy CRT post-processing.
 *
 * Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
 * Prerequisites:
 *   Basics         https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
 *   PipBoy CRT     https://demos.blit386.dev/crt-pipboy
 *   Keyboard Input https://demos.blit386.dev/keyboard-input
 *
 * Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/snake-game
 *
 * Move with WASD or the arrow keys (both are mapped to player 0 face buttons). On a phone
 * or tablet, steer with the on-screen D-pad in the bottom-right corner (it appears at the
 * first touch) or simply swipe anywhere in the direction you want to go - both come from
 * the shared UI kit in src/shared/ui.js. Each food dot grows the snake and makes it
 * one step faster. Hitting the boundary wall or your own body ends the run; the game
 * restarts after two seconds.
 * Gameplay uses rectangles; a short systemPrint note appears in software mode.
 *
 * Post-processing matches the PipBoy CRT demo when WebGPU is active. In software fallback mode the
 * snake game still runs; CRT effects are skipped and a short note is shown on canvas.
 *
 * WebGPU path: PixelGlitch on the logical index buffer, then palette resolve + upscale,
 * then display-tier barrel distortion, chromatic aberration, interference, rolling scan
 * line, scanlines, RGB mask, vignette, noise, flicker, bloom, and the glitch state machine.
 *
 * Eating food and dying both play a synthesized sound effect (built with AudioClip.synth(),
 * the same technique Synth Toy explores in depth). An upbeat music loop plays in the
 * background; each food multiplies its playback rate so the beat climbs with snake length.
