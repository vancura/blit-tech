/**
 * Audio Basics Demo - loading sounds, playing them, and the "click to allow sound" rule.
 * @description Load a clip, play it with volume, pitch, and pan variation, and handle the first-gesture audio unlock.
 *
 * Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
 * Prerequisites:
 *   Pointer Basics  https://demos.blit386.dev/pointer-basics
 *   Keyboard Input  https://demos.blit386.dev/keyboard-input
 *
 * Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/audio-basics
 *
 * Every web browser refuses to make any sound at all until you click or press a key on
 * the page - this is called the "autoplay policy," and it exists so a page you just
 * opened cannot suddenly blast noise at you without asking first. BT.isAudioUnlocked
 * tells you whether that first click or key press has happened yet.
 *
 * This page loads two short sound effects with AudioClip.load() and plays them with
 * BT.soundPlay(), which can also change how a sound plays each time:
 * - pitch: how fast the sound plays back. Higher pitch sounds faster and higher, like
 *   speeding up a cassette tape. Lower pitch sounds slower and deeper.
 * - volume: how loud the sound is, from 0 (silent) to 1 (full volume).
 * - pan: which speaker the sound favors, from -1 (only the left speaker) through 0
 *   (centered) to +1 (only the right speaker).
 *
 * The panels and buttons come from the shared UI kit in src/shared/ui.js, so each pitch
 * preset works three ways: click its button, tap it on a phone, or press its number key.
 *
 * The engine's built-in overlay can also show live audio meters: little bars that move
 * up and down with how loud each audio bus (main, music, sfx) is right now, plus a
 * count of how many sounds are playing at once. This demo turns that feature on with
 * `isOverlayAudioMetersEnabled: true` in configure() - open the overlay (see below) and
 * watch the meters jump every time a blip or pop plays.
 *
 * Try this:
 * - Click anywhere, or press any key, to unlock sound - watch the message at the top
 *   change once you do.
 * - Press 1, 2, or 3 (or tap the matching button) to play a short "blip" at a low,
 *   normal, or high pitch.
 * - Click near the top of the screen for a loud "pop," or near the bottom for a quiet
 *   one. Click near the left or right edge to hear it pan toward that speaker
 *   (headphones or stereo speakers make this easiest to hear).
 * - Press the backquote key (`) or click the small icon in the bottom-left corner to
 *   open the engine overlay, then play a few sounds and watch the audio meters move.
