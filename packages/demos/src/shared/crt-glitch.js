/**
 * Shared CRT "TV fault" glitch constants for the five glitch-driven demos.
 *
 * Two glitch-type sets exist here by design, not by accident: the full-color group
 * (crt-pipboy, snake-game, basics-enhanced) includes 'chromasplit', a color-channel
 * split that only reads as a glitch on a color CRT. The Tesla Orava B/W group
 * (sprite-effects, logo-lowres) swaps that for 'vroll', a vertical roll - a fault a
 * black-and-white tube shows instead, since it has no color channels to split. Before
 * this module existed the two groups' overlapping type keys (hshift/noise/flicker/
 * interference) had drifted to different on-screen labels between the two groups -
 * see .claude/rules/named-constants.md for the worked example. GLITCH_LABELS below is
 * the fix: one canonical label per key, covering both groups' full key set.
 *
 * applyGlitchUniforms()/resetGlitchUniforms() are shared ONLY by crt-pipboy.js,
 * snake-game.js, and basics-enhanced.js - their glitch-apply code and tuning constants
 * were verified byte-for-byte identical before this extraction. sprite-effects.js and
 * logo-lowres.js have real behavioral differences from that group and from each other
 * (different tuning constants, logo-lowres's hshift also drives chroma aberration, its
 * flicker scales by peak instead of envelope) and keep their own bespoke apply methods -
 * they only import the type list and labels from here, not the shared functions.
