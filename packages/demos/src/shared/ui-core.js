/**
 * Core of the shared demo UI kit - the frame lifecycle, layout math, and input plumbing.
 *
 * The kit works like a tiny "immediate-mode" UI (the style made famous by Dear ImGui):
 * a demo does not build widget objects up front - it simply calls ui.panel(), ui.button(),
 * ui.kv(), and so on every frame inside render(), and the kit draws and hit-tests them on
 * the spot. That keeps demo code short, but it needs two tricks to stay fast and correct:
 *
 * 1. Deferred drawing. A panel's final width and position are not known until its last row
 *    is declared (auto width comes from the widest row; a bottom-anchored panel is placed
 *    once its total height is known). So widgets never draw directly - they append small
 *    "command" records with panel-relative coordinates to a preallocated pool, and ui.end()
 *    resolves the panel's origin and replays the commands through the real BT draw calls.
 *    All the pool objects are allocated once and reused, so steady-state rendering allocates
 *    nothing - the one performance rule that actually matters in render().
 *
 * 2. One-frame-old hit rectangles. A widget cannot know its absolute position while it is
 *    being declared (see above), so interaction tests use the rectangle the widget ended up
 *    at LAST frame, cached in a map. Panels sit still, so being one frame behind is
 *    invisible at 60 FPS. This is the same trade Dear ImGui makes.
 *
 * Input timing (why some things happen in update() and others in render()):
 * - Pointer press/release edges are snapshotted by the engine AFTER render() each display
 *   frame, so reading them from render() is safe - buttons hit-test right where they draw.
 * - Keyboard edges (BT.isKeyPressed) clear once per fixed-update tick, which runs BEFORE
 *   render(). Reading them from render() would randomly miss presses. The kit solves this
 *   with a small "mailbox": ui.tick() (called from update()) checks the keys widgets asked
 *   about and drops any press into a set; the widget picks it up next render. See tick().
