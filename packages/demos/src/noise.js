// Noise: turning scrambled numbers into landscapes.
// @description Value, Perlin, and Simplex noise at matched settings, with an octaves slider and a terrain ramp.
//
// Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
//
// Prerequisites:
//   Basics               https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
//   Random Basics        https://demos.blit386.dev/random-basics
//   Coordinate Patterns  https://demos.blit386.dev/coordinate-patterns
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE
// A landscape that you can reshape with the controls. Switch between three ways of making
// noise, stack extra layers of detail on top of each other, zoom in and out, and set it
// drifting like clouds.
//
// WHERE THIS CARRIES ON FROM
// The Coordinate Patterns demo gave every tile its own scrambled number, and the result
// looked like static: https://demos.blit386.dev/coordinate-patterns
// Real landscapes are not static. Next to a hilltop you find more hilltop, not sea. Noise
// fixes exactly that: it still works out an answer from a position, but nearby positions
// now get answers close to each other. That single change turns speckle into scenery.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
//   - noise2D(x, y) gives a smooth value from -1 to 1 for any spot you ask about
//   - Three flavors - Value, Perlin, and Simplex - each with a different character
//   - "Octaves" means stacking the same noise again, smaller and fainter each time, which
//     is what adds crags to smooth hills. That stack is called fbm
//   - noise3D(x, y, z) uses the third number as time, which makes clouds drift
//   - Bigger blocks mean fewer squares to draw, so the picture is coarser but much cheaper
//
// The engine splits work the usual way: update() moves things; render() only draws.
// See the Basics demo for the full story: https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
