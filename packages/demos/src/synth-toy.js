/**
 * Synth Toy Demo - procedural chip-tune sound effects with no audio files at all.
 * @description Procedural chip-tune sound effects with no audio files: six presets plus a key that rolls a new one.
 *
 * Prerequisites:
 *   Keyboard Input  https://demos.blit386.dev/keyboard-input
 *   Audio Basics    https://demos.blit386.dev/audio-basics
 *
 * Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/synth-toy
 *
 * Every sound on this page is built from scratch by the computer, the instant you press a
 * key or tap a button - there are no sound files to download. AudioClip.synth() takes a
 * small recipe called SynthParams (a waveform shape, a pitch, a length, and a few optional
 * knobs like an attack/decay/sustain/release envelope, a pitch sweep, and a noise mix) and
 * calculates every single sample of the resulting sound on the spot. BT.synthPreset bundles
 * six of these recipes for common game sounds - jump, pickup, explosion, laser, hit, and a
 * UI blip - tuned by hand so they sound right without you needing to pick every number
 * yourself.
 *
 * The Randomize button goes the other way: instead of a hand-tuned recipe, it rolls a brand
 * new SynthParams object with every field chosen at random, inside safe ranges, and shows
 * you exactly what was rolled in the right-hand panel. Play it a few times and you will
 * hear (and see) how much variety a handful of numbers can produce - from a clean sine
 * "boop" to a noisy sawtooth growl. (The synth engine also supports a vibrato wobble on top
 * of all this - this demo leaves it out to keep the panel small, but it is worth trying
 * yourself.)
 *
 * The panels and buttons come from the shared UI kit in src/shared/ui.js, so every preset
 * works three ways: click it, tap it on a phone, or press its keyboard shortcut.
 *
 * This page unlocks sound the same "click or press a key first" way audio-basics does -
 * browsers refuse to make any sound until you interact with the page at least once.
 *
 * The engine's built-in overlay also shows live audio meters: little bars that move
 * up and down with how loud each audio bus (main, music, sfx) is right now, plus a
 * count of how many sounds are playing at once. This demo turns that feature on with
 * `isOverlayAudioMetersEnabled: true` in configure() - watch the meters jump every time a
 * preset or a randomized sound plays.
 *
 * Try this:
 * - Click anywhere, or press any key, to unlock sound - watch the message at the top change
 *   once you do.
 * - Tap the preset buttons (or press J, P, E, L, H, or B) to hear the jump, pickup,
 *   explosion, laser, hit, and blip presets.
 * - Tap Randomize (or press R) to hear a randomized sound - watch the right-hand panel
 *   update with the waveform, frequency, duration, noise mix, and pitch sweep target that
 *   were rolled.
 * - Randomize again and again - notice how differently the exact same few lines of "roll a
 *   random number" code can make the engine sound each time.
