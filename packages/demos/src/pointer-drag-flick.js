/**
 * Pointer Drag-and-Flick Demo - grab balls, drag them, release to throw.
 * @description Grab one of three bouncing balls, drag it, and release to throw it, with synthesized sound effects.
 *
 * Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
 * Prerequisites:
 *   Pointer Basics - https://demos.blit386.dev/pointer-basics
 *   Pointer Paint  - https://demos.blit386.dev/pointer-paint
 *
 * Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/pointer-drag-flick
 *
 * This is the action-oriented sibling of pointer-basics and pointer-paint. Where
 * pointer-basics reads pointer state and pointer-paint paints onto a canvas, this demo couples the pointer
 * to a tiny physics simulation:
 *
 *   - Three balls bounce around inside a closed box under gravity.
 *   - Click and HOLD on a ball to grab it (the ball follows the pointer).
 *   - RELEASE to throw it - the release-frame BT.pointerDelta becomes the
 *     ball's launch velocity.
 *
 * On a touchscreen each finger can grab its own ball; up to three balls can
 * be dragged at once (slots 1, 2, 3). The mouse uses slot 0.
 *
 * What this demonstrates that pointer-basics and pointer-paint do not:
 *
 *   - BT.isPressed(...) as a "grab" edge: only fires the frame the
 *     button transitions to down, used to start the drag exactly once.
 *   - BT.isReleased(...) as a "throw" edge: only fires the frame the
 *     button transitions to up. We sample BT.pointerDelta during this
 *     edge to capture the user's release-time hand velocity.
 *   - BT.pointerDelta actively driving simulation, not just shown as text.
 *
 * Two custom sounds, both built with AudioClip.synth() (the technique Synth Toy
 * explores in depth): a whoosh on every throw, whose pitch and volume scale with how hard
 * you flicked, and a thud every time a ball hits a wall or the floor hard enough to notice.
 *
 * The HUD (the title strip along the top and the per-slot pointer indicators in the
 * top-right corner) is drawn with the shared UI kit (src/shared/ui.js), so it uses the
 * same colors and layout as every other demo. The balls themselves keep their own scene
 * colors and are grabbed with raw pointer reads - the kit only handles the readouts.
 *
 * Coordinate convention: balls store position with sub-pixel precision
 * (floats) so physics integrates smoothly, but every render call rounds to
 * integer display coordinates so pixels stay crisp.
