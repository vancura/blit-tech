// Palette Exposure Fade: two ways to fade the same picture, side by side.

//
// TWO KINDS OF FADE
//
// In the Palette Fade demo we used BT.paletteFade(). It mixes the numbers a color
// is stored as. Every color gets dimmer by the same share at the same moment, so
// the whole picture sinks into gray together. That is what film editors do AFTER
// a movie is shot, on a computer.
//
// A real camera does something different. It has a hole called an iris, and
// closing it lets in less LIGHT. The picture keeps looking bright for a while,
// then falls away quickly near the end. Bright things like a fireball hang on far
// longer than the dark rocks around it, which go black almost at once.
//
// BT.paletteFadeExposure() copies the camera. It dims light instead of stored
// numbers, and it gives each color its own start time based on how bright that
// color is. Bright colors leave first and arrive last; dark colors leave last and
// arrive first.
//
// WHY FADING UP LOOKS DIFFERENT FROM FADING DOWN
//
// The two directions are not simple reverses of each other, and that is on
// purpose. Every color's start time is set by how bright its LIT end is - but
// which end counts as "lit" depends on which way the fade is going:
//
//   Fading up   - timed by where each color is headed. A color heading toward
//                 white starts rising almost at once and arrives early. A color
//                 heading toward near-black waits, then rushes to catch up.
//   Fading down - timed by where each color started. A color that started bright
//                 keeps its brightness for a while before it begins to dim. A
//                 color that started dark begins dropping right away.
//
// Same rule both times - "the brightest end of the trip gets the head start" -
// just pointed at a different end of the trip. That is why, on the way up, the
// shadows are the ones that wait; on the way down, the fireball is the one that
// waits instead.
//
// WHY THE SCREEN IS SPLIT
//
// Both halves show the SAME picture with the SAME colors, start at the SAME
// moment, and take the SAME two seconds. The only thing that differs is which
// fade drives them:
//
//   Left  - BT.paletteFadeRange(), the plain "mix the numbers" fade
//   Right - BT.paletteFadeExposure(), the camera-style fade
//
// So anything you see differing between the halves comes from the curve alone.
//
// ONE PICTURE, DRAWN TWICE
//
// The picture is a real image file: public/sprites/mushroom-cloud.png, a 231x240
// painting of an explosion lighting up a canyon. It is drawn with exactly twelve
// different colors, and it happens to hold both extremes this demo needs - a
// blazing white-hot cloud at the top and near-black rock in the shadows.
//
// Getting it onto the screen takes three steps:
//
//   1. SpriteSheet.loadColorsIntoPalette() walks every pixel of the PNG, collects
//      the colors it finds, and writes them into palette slots 1..12, darkest
//      first. It hands the same list back to us as an array.
//   2. We copy that same list of twelve colors into slots 16..27 as well, so the
//      palette now holds the picture's colors twice over, in two separate places.
//   3. sheet.indexize() rewrites the image itself: every pixel stops storing a
//      color and starts storing a slot NUMBER, from 1 to 12.
//
// After that, one BT.drawSprite() call draws the image as it is, reading slots
// 1..12. A second call draws the very same image with a palette offset of 15,
// which adds 15 to every pixel's slot number as it is drawn - so the identical
// pixels read slots 16..27 instead. Same picture, second set of colors, and no
// second copy of the image in memory. We met that trick in the Sprite Effects
// demo: https://demos.blit386.dev/sprite-effects
//
// HOW THE TWO FADES STAY OUT OF EACH OTHER'S WAY
//
// A palette is one long list of 256 color slots, and a fade writes into that
// list. If both fades wrote into the same slots they would fight over them, and
// the last one to run each frame would win. So each half owns its own slots:
//
//   Slots 1..12   - the right half's picture (the exposure fade)
//   Slots 16..27  - the left half's picture (the plain fade)
//   Slots 240..251 - the shared UI panel colors (neither fade touches these)
//
// BT.paletteFadeRange(start, end, ...) already takes a slot range, so the left
// half is easy. For the right half we use a trick the engine supports on
// purpose: BT.paletteFadeExposure() leaves alone any slot past the END of the
// target palette you hand it. Our exposure target is only 16 slots long, so the
// fade can only ever reach slots 1..15 and never disturbs the left half or the UI.
//
// THE PALETTE GRID
//
// The engine overlay is open from the first frame, with its palette grid switched
// on, so you can watch the slots themselves rather than only the pictures. Each
// small square is one of the 256 slots, laid out fifteen to a row. The first row
// holds the exposure fade's slots 1..12 and the second row holds the plain fade's
// 16..27, one group directly above the other, so during a fade you can see the
// first group's bright slots run ahead of the second group while its dark slots
// lag behind - the whole point of the effect, as raw numbers.
//
// Press ~ (or tap the symbol in the bottom-left corner) to close the overlay and
// watch just the pictures.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE:
//   An explosion over a canyon, drawn twice. The cycle repeats forever:
//   1. Fade up from black - 2 seconds
//   2. Hold, fully lit    - 1.5 seconds
//   3. Fade down to black - 2 seconds
//   4. Hold, dark         - 1 second
//   On the way up, the right fireball lights before the left one and the right
//   shadows stay black longer. On the way down, the right fireball is still
//   glowing after the left one has gone gray, and the right shadows die first.
//   Drag the "Highlight lead" slider to change how strong that difference is.
//   At 0 the right half behaves like a plain fade in light; higher is more
//   cinematic.
