// @pageTitle BLIT386 Demo – CRT Toggle
// @description Turn a whole CRT post-process stack on and off at runtime, switching every two seconds as it runs.
//
// CRT Toggle: turn the post-process effects on and off in flight.
//
// Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
// Prerequisites:
//   Basics     https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
//   PipBoy CRT https://demos.blit386.dev/crt-pipboy
//
// Live version: https://demos.blit386.dev/crt-toggle
//
// Guide: https://blit386.dev/docs/guides/post-process-effects
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE
// A colorful, simple scene - bouncing squares and a few horizontal bars. Every two seconds
// the CRT preset flips on and off automatically. Status text sits in a small panel drawn
// with the shared UI kit. While it is on
// you see scanlines, the RGB shadow mask, smooth barrel curvature, and a soft phosphor
// glow; while it is off the pixels are exactly what the engine drew (no post-processing).
// The bouncing keeps going either way, so you can compare the two looks side by side.
//
// Notice that the lines stay STRAIGHT through the toggle: barrel distortion is display-tier,
// so it runs on RGBA after palette resolve + upscale to the canvas size - not on the
// 320x240 index buffer - which avoids stair-step artifacts on diagonals.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
//   - How to add and remove a STACK of post-process effects at runtime.
//   - That the effect chain is "free" when nothing is registered: the engine renders straight
//     to the screen with zero extra cost. The first call to BT.effectAdd allocates an off-
//     screen texture; the last BT.effectRemove or BT.effectClear frees it again.
//   - That you keep the SAME effect instances across toggles. Demos that destroy and
//     recreate them on every toggle would also work, but they would re-create the GPU
//     pipeline on every toggle - wasteful when the look is the same.
//   - The convenience of `BT.preset.crtPipBoy()`: returns a fresh array of pre-configured
//     display-tier effects so you do not have to wire them up by hand.
//
// HOW THE TOGGLE WORKS
// We measure time in ticks (60 per second). Every TOGGLE_PERIOD_TICKS the demo flips a
// boolean and either adds or removes the entire preset stack. A small kit panel shows
// "CRT: ON" or "CRT: OFF" so you always know which side you are looking at.
//
// SOFTWARE FALLBACK
// In software renderer mode, post-process effects are unavailable. The bouncing
// squares and color bars still animate; CRT toggle is disabled and the status panel
// explains why.
//
// Why auto-toggle instead of a button? This page focuses on the effect API, not controls.
// Auto-toggling keeps the ON/OFF comparison hands-free. Pointer and keyboard input are
// covered in the pointer and keyboard demos.
