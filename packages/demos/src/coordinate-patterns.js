// Coordinate Patterns: an endless world that remembers nothing at all.
// @description An endless world computed from hash1i, hash2i, and hash3i that stores no tiles, yet never changes.
//
// Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
//
// Prerequisites:
//   Basics        https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
//   Random Basics https://demos.blit386.dev/random-basics
//   Seeded Worlds https://demos.blit386.dev/seeded-worlds
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE
// A world you can scroll around forever with the arrow keys, the on-screen D-pad, or a
// swipe. Press "Jump far" to fling yourself thousands of tiles away, then "Home" to come
// straight back - and find every tile exactly where you left it.
//
// Nothing was saved. The demo stores zero tiles. Each square works out what it is from
// nothing but its own position.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
//   - hash1i(x, seed) turns one number into a scrambled-but-repeatable number
//   - hash2i(x, y, seed) does the same for a pair, which is what a tile map needs
//   - hash3i(x, y, z, seed) adds a third number, so you get a whole new set of answers
//   - "Stateless" means the answer is worked out fresh every time, never looked up
//
// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM SEEDED WORLDS
// The Seeded Worlds demo rolls its hills and trees once and keeps the list in memory:
// https://demos.blit386.dev/seeded-worlds
// This demo keeps nothing. Ask about tile (4000, -812) and it answers instantly, without
// ever having visited it. That is how games fit worlds far too big for memory.
//
// WHY IT LOOKS LIKE STATIC
// Every tile is scrambled on its own, so a tile knows nothing about its neighbors. That is
// why the world looks speckled rather than like real countryside, where a lake is one big
// lake instead of scattered puddles. Smoothing that speckle into rolling hills is what the
// Noise demo is for: https://demos.blit386.dev/noise
//
// WATCH THE LAYER SLIDER CLOSELY
// The ground comes from hash2i, which only knows x and y - so sliding the layer leaves the
// landscape untouched. The little rocks come from hash3i, which also knows the layer - so
// they change completely. Same place, different detail: that is the third number at work.
//
// The engine splits work the usual way: update() moves things; render() only draws.
// See the Basics demo for the full story: https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
