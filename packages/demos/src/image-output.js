// Image Output: demonstrates BT.downloadFrame().
// @description Take a screenshot of whatever is on screen with BT.downloadFrame and save it straight out as a PNG.
//
// BT.downloadFrame() takes a screenshot of whatever is currently on screen and saves
// it as a PNG image file to your computer. Click or tap the "Save PNG" button from the
// shared UI kit (or press S) to download the current frame – so the demo works on
// touch screens too. Note: the kit panel is drawn on screen, so it appears in the
// saved PNG as well. That is fine for this demo – see the comment in render().
//
// Dev-mode extras, built into the engine itself (every demo gets these for free,
// not just this one): while BT.isDevMode is true (running from `pnpm run dev`, not
// a production build), pressing F9 copies the current frame to the OS clipboard, and
// Shift+F9 saves it as a timestamped file – neither needs a button click first. See
// HardwareSettings.isFrameCaptureShortcutEnabled.
// Note for demos other than this one: both shortcuts save at the logical
// BT.displaySize, not BT.outputSize, so they stay pixel-for-pixel even when a demo
// sets a larger drawingBufferSize for display-tier post-process effects (CRT,
// vignette, and the like) – those effects are not included in either shortcut's
// output. This demo has no drawingBufferSize, so its own shortcut output is
// unaffected and still matches the Save PNG button above.
// The engine also exposes the whole BT namespace as window.BT in dev mode
// (BootstrapOptions.exposeGlobal, on by default), so you can run
// window.BT.downloadFrame('my-file.png') straight from the browser console at any time.
