// Seeded Worlds: the same number always builds the same world.
// @description Two worlds side by side, each labeled with its seed. Copy one seed over and the halves match exactly.
//
// Part of the BLIT386 demo series.
//
// Prerequisites:
//   Basics        https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
//   Random Basics https://demos.blit386.dev/random-basics
//
// WHAT YOU WILL SEE
// Two little worlds side by side. Each one was built out of random numbers - the hills, the
// buildings, the trees, the stars. Above each world is the number it grew from, called its
// "seed". Press the buttons to give either side a new seed and watch it rebuild.
//
// Then press "Copy left seed" and watch the right world turn into an exact twin of the left
// one. Same number in, same world out, every single time.
//
// WHAT YOU WILL LEARN
//   - BT.randomSeed(n) tells the engine which number to start its randomness from
//   - The same seed always produces the same sequence, so it produces the same world
//   - BT.random.seedValue reads that number back, even the one the engine picked by itself
//   - clone() copies a generator so both continue with the same numbers
//   - fork() splits off a new generator that goes its own way
//
// WHY THIS IS USEFUL
// A game can hand you a puzzle from seed 4821 and know every player gets the identical
// puzzle. A saved game can store one number instead of a whole map. And when a run goes
// really well, you can write the seed down and play it again.
//
// The engine splits work the usual way: update() moves things; render() only draws.
// See the Basics demo for the full story: https://demos.blit386.dev/basics
