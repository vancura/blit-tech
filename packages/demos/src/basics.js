/**
 * Basics Demo - Your very first BLIT386 program!
 * @description Your first BLIT386 program: the engine lifecycle, a bouncing sprite, a palette, and text on the canvas.
 *
 * Welcome! This demo teaches you the absolute basics of making things appear
 * on screen with the BLIT386 engine. You will learn:
 *   - How a demo is structured (configure, init, update, render, overlayRows)
 *   - How to pick colors with a palette and clear the screen
 *   - How to load a sprite (a tiny picture) and draw it
 *   - How to make that sprite move and bounce off the screen edges
 *   - How smooth motion works when update() and render() run at different speeds
 *     (BT.renderAlpha + Vector2i.lerp)
 *   - How to show a text hint with the shared UI kit (ui.label)
 *   - How to show live stats and a timing chart in the engine overlay
 *     (overlayRows, BT.assignTag)
 *
 * If you are new to BLIT386, read this file carefully from top to bottom.
 * Almost every block has a comment explaining what it does and why.
 *
 * This demo sets targetFPS to 30 in configure() (slower than the engine default of 60)
 * so motion is easy to follow. update() therefore runs about 30 times per second.
 *
 * IMPORTANT - update() vs. render():
 *
 * update() runs at a FIXED rate (targetFPS from configure()). It is where you do
 * all game logic: move things, check wall collisions, count bounces. It may run
 * multiple times per screen refresh if the computer needs to catch up, but never
 * more than 8 times in a row.
 *
 * render() runs ONCE per screen refresh (often 60 times per second on a laptop
 * screen, but it can be faster on 120 or 144 times-per-second monitors). It is
 * where you draw everything. NEVER put game logic here - only drawing code.
 *
 * When you switch to a different browser tab, BOTH update() and render() pause
 * completely. The browser stops calling them to save battery. When you come
 * back, the engine catches up with a few extra update() calls (up to 8) so
 * your game does not jump forward in time by a huge amount.

/**
 * "import" loads tools from the BLIT386 engine library.

 *   - BT: the main engine object - you call BT.clear(), BT.drawSprite(), etc.
 *   - Color32: represents a color with Red, Green, Blue (and optional Alpha)
 *   - SpriteSheet: a loaded image you can draw pieces of on screen (a "sprite")
 *   - Vector2i: a 2D point or direction using whole numbers (x, y)

/**
 * Bouncing-sprite demo - a friendly first BLIT386 demo.
 *
 * Every BLIT386 demo is a class the engine drives. Three methods are required;
 * configure() and overlayRows() are optional extras this file also uses:
 *
 *   1. configure() - optional. If you define it, the engine calls it once at
 *      the very start so you can change settings (FPS, overlay options, and more).
 *      If you skip it, you get sensible defaults (320x240, 640x480 output, 60 FPS).
 *
 *   2. init() - called once after hardware settings are ready. This is where you
 *      load images, set up colors, and pick starting positions. It uses "async"
 *      because loading files takes time, and we need to wait for them to finish
 *      (like waiting for a web page to load).
 *
 *   3. update() - called at the targetFPS rate (30 per second in this demo).
 *      This is where you move the sprite, flip speed when it hits a wall, and
 *      count bounces. It runs at a FIXED pace so motion matches on fast and slow
 *      computers. See the file header for the full explanation.
 *
 *   4. overlayRows() - optional. Feeds extra text lines into the engine overlay
 *      (the HUD you toggle with the ~ key). Not required, but handy for live stats.
 *
 *   5. render() - called once per screen refresh to draw everything. Clear the
 *      screen, draw shapes, print text - all drawing goes here.

     *
     * render() runs AFTER update(). By the time render() is called, all
     * positions and scores are already calculated. render() just reads
     * those values and draws the picture.
     *
     * IMPORTANT: render() runs once per screen refresh (your monitor's refresh
     * rate - often 60, but 120 or 144 on gaming displays). Do NOT put game logic
     * here because it would run at different speeds on different monitors.
     *
     * Every frame you must clear the screen and redraw everything from
     * scratch. If you skip clearing, the old frame stays and new drawings
     * pile up on top of it (which can look cool, but is usually a bug!).
     *
     * WHY THE SPRITE MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT STUTTERS WITHOUT THE FIX BELOW:
     * This demo sets targetFPS to 30 (see configure() above), but render() still
     * runs at your monitor's full refresh rate - 60, 120, whatever your screen
     * supports. That means update() (which moves the sprite) and render()
     * (which draws it) run at DIFFERENT speeds. On a 60-times-per-second monitor,
     * render() runs roughly twice for every one update() - so if render() just
     * drew this.pos every time, the sprite would sit frozen for one refresh, then
     * hop forward, then sit frozen again. That hop-hop-hop motion is "stutter."
     *
     * THE FIX: BT.renderAlpha. Think of it like a movie: update() ticks are the
     * individual film frames (say, one every two screen refreshes), and render()
     * is a projector that can run faster than the film advances. BT.renderAlpha
     * tells the projector how far along we are between "the last film frame" and
     * "the next one" - a fraction from 0 (the last update() tick just finished) up
     * to just under 1 (the next update() tick is about to happen). We use it below
     * to blend prevPos (where the sprite WAS) toward pos (where it IS) so every
     * single render() draws the sprite at its true in-between position instead of
     * only where it was as of the last tick.

//   3. Creating a new instance of your Demo class
//   4. Calling configure() when you define it, then init(), then the update/render loop
//
// After this line runs, your demo is alive and running!
