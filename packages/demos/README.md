# BLIT386 Demos

Interactive examples for [BLIT386](https://github.com/blit386/blit386/), a palette-first WebGPU retro engine for
TypeScript.

Each demo shows a different feature of the engine. Source files in `src/` use plain JavaScript with lots of comments
explaining how everything works.

Want to build your own game with the engine? Start with the
[create-blit386](https://github.com/blit386/blit386/tree/main/packages/create-blit386) scaffolder
(`npm create blit386@latest my-game`).

There are 45 demo modules today, covering drawing, palettes, post-process CRT effects, input (pointer, keyboard,
gamepad), audio, and seeded randomness. Each demo lives in a single number-free kebab-case file under `src/` (for
example `src/basics.js`). Navigation order comes from `plugins/demo-order.js` (`DEMO_ORDER`), not from filenames. Most
demos import the shared UI kit in `src/shared/` for their on-screen panels and touch controls (see
[Shared UI kit](#shared-ui-kit) below for the four exceptions). During development, Vite serves the matching page at
`/demos/basics.html` (no HTML file is committed; the build wires a shared layout to each script). The default page is a
persistent shell (navigation banner + iframe). The banner's demo selector is a fuzzy-searchable combobox (type to filter
by title). The iframe loads the same demo with `?embed&source`, which runs the canvas, keeps the Twoslash source panel
under it, and lets demo swaps discard the engine with the frame. Direct `?embed` URLs (and website iframes) hide the
banner and source panel for a centered full-viewport canvas.

Hosted site: Browse every demo at [demos.blit386.dev](https://demos.blit386.dev/). Live URLs use a flat, number-free
path per slug, for example `https://demos.blit386.dev/basics`. Older numbered (vintage) URLs such as `/001-basics` still
work: the build writes permanent 301 redirects from every entry in `plugins/demo-vintage-urls.js` (`VINTAGE_URLS`) into
`dist/_redirects`.

The demos build on each other in `DEMO_ORDER` where it matters; later pages assume you have seen the ideas from earlier
ones.

Each demo passes a class to `bootstrap()` from `blit386`. Optional `configure()` overrides resolution and FPS; if you
omit it, the engine applies `defaultConfig()` (`320x240` logical, `640x480` canvas, `60` FPS). Every demo still
implements `init()`, `update()`, and `render()`.

The engine draws a unified stats overlay on top of each frame (FPS, target FPS, backend, resolution, demo title). The
overlay body starts hidden; a small bitmap toggle hint sits in the bottom-left corner by default. Press Backquote (`~`)
or tap the bottom-left 17x13 px corner to show or hide the body. Opt into a body that is visible on the first frame with
`isOverlayVisibleAtStart: true`. Immersive demos hide the hint icon with `isOverlayToggleHintVisible: false` (see
`image-output`, `game-scene`, `crt-pipboy`, and `snake-game`); the overlay still toggles with Backquote. Set
`isOverlayToggleEnabled: false` to lock body visibility, or `isOverlayEnabled: false` in `configure()` to disable the
overlay subsystem entirely.

## Demos

Below, each title links to the deployed page (number-free slug). Vintage numbered paths such as `/001-basics` redirect
to these URLs via `VINTAGE_URLS`.

### Drawing Basics

- [hello-world](https://demos.blit386.dev/hello-world) - The classic first program: "Hello, World!" on screen, nothing
  else
- [basics](https://demos.blit386.dev/basics) - Engine basics, lifecycle, bouncing sprite, canvas text
- [basics-enhanced](https://demos.blit386.dev/basics-enhanced) - Enhanced version of the basics demo with optional

- [logo-lowres](https://demos.blit386.dev/logo-lowres) - Logo sprite centered on a tiny 80x60 screen, upscaled 3x to
  240x180 with nearest-neighbor filtering, then wrapped in the Tesla Orava black-and-white CRT stack (scanlines,
  scrolling roll line, flicker, RGB mask, vignette, bloom, and random analog-TV fault bursts) with a shared UI-kit
  status chip naming the current fault. The one demo that turns the engine overlay off entirely

- [tilemap](https://demos.blit386.dev/tilemap) - Grid-based tile world with camera

### Randomness

- [random-basics](https://demos.blit386.dev/random-basics) - Five switchable scenes for the `BT.random` generators the
  other demos do not reach for: `shuffle` versus `shuffleInPlace`, `weighted` loot drops with a live tally, `gaussian`
  scatter against flat `float` scatter, `sign` coin flips, and `direction4` versus `direction8` walkers
- [seeded-worlds](https://demos.blit386.dev/seeded-worlds) - Two worlds side by side, each labeled with the seed read
  back from `BT.random.seedValue`. Copy one seed onto the other and the halves become identical, plus a `clone()` versus
  `fork()` stream comparison
- [coordinate-patterns](https://demos.blit386.dev/coordinate-patterns) - An endless scrollable world computed from
  `hash1i` / `hash2i` / `hash3i` that stores zero tiles. Jump thousands of tiles away and back to find it unchanged; the
  layer slider shows terrain ignoring the third coordinate while decorations follow it
- [noise](https://demos.blit386.dev/noise) - `ValueNoise`, `PerlinNoise`, and `SimplexNoise` at matched settings, with
  an octaves slider switching between `noise2D` and `fbm2D`, a terrain or grayscale ramp, and a drift toggle driving the
  3D variants

### Palette System

  bouncing balls, release with `pointerDelta` as launch velocity. Multi-touch grabs one ball per finger. Throws and wall
  bounces play synthesized whoosh/thud sound effects.
- [keyboard-input](https://demos.blit386.dev/keyboard-input) - Keyboard face buttons for two players (`BT.BTN_UP` …
  `BT.BTN_SELECT`), raw `BT.isKeyDown` / `BT.isKeyPressed` (optional tick repeat) / `BT.isKeyReleased`, and typed text
  via `BT.inputString`
- [keyboard-diagnostic](https://demos.blit386.dev/keyboard-diagnostic) - Full on-screen keyboard layout with press /
  hold / release color feedback; use to verify fast taps on high-refresh displays
- [snake-game](https://demos.blit386.dev/snake-game) - Grid snake with walls, food, keyboard, D-pad, and swipe steering,
  PipBoy-style CRT post-processing, synth SFX on eat/game-over, and a looping background music track
- [input-map-remapping](https://demos.blit386.dev/input-map-remapping) - Runtime face-button remapping with
  `BT.inputMap` / `BT.inputMapReset` (defaults, custom OR keys, clearing a binding); complements `keyboard-input`

  analog sticks, triggers, and face button masks (`BT.BTN_A | BT.BTN_B`) with `BT.getAxis` / `BT.isGamepadConnected` /
  `BT.gamepadCount`

### Post-Process Effects

  mask, bloom, glitch state machine) built from individual decomposed effects
- [crt-toggle](https://demos.blit386.dev/crt-toggle) - Toggle the entire `BT.preset.crtPipBoy()` CRT stack on and off at
  runtime - auto-switches between clean and CRT output every two seconds

### Audio

- [audio-basics](https://demos.blit386.dev/audio-basics) - Loading clips with `AudioClip.load()`, playing SFX on a key
  press and a pointer click with volume/pitch/pan variation, and the `BT.isAudioUnlocked` first-gesture prompt;
  `isOverlayAudioMetersEnabled` shows live bus-level meters and a voice-count readout in the overlay
- [synth-toy](https://demos.blit386.dev/synth-toy) - Procedural chip-tune SFX built entirely with `AudioClip.synth()`:
  six keyboard-triggered presets (jump/pickup/explosion/laser/hit/blip) via `BT.synthPreset`, plus a randomize key that
  rolls a fresh `SynthParams` object to show off waveform, envelope, pitch-sweep, and noise-mix variation; also opts
  into the overlay's live audio meters via `isOverlayAudioMetersEnabled`
- [music](https://demos.blit386.dev/music) - Crossfading between two looping tracks with two different `BT.musicPlay()`
  fade profiles, plus a third track demonstrating a seamless `loopStart`/`loopEnd` region after a one-time intro
- [audio-buses](https://demos.blit386.dev/audio-buses) - Mixer bus control: draggable `main`/`music`/`sfx` volume
  sliders, per-bus mute toggles that preserve the stored volume, and an alert button that ducks the music bus with
  `BT.audioVolumeSet()`

## Shared UI kit

All on-screen demo UI - panels, labels, key-value rows, checkboxes, pips, buttons, sliders, meters, a virtual touch
D-pad, swipes, and tap zones - comes from a small shared kit in `src/shared/`. It is imported by 42 of the 46 demos.
Four demos are deliberate exceptions: `flurry` (an immersive screensaver with no demo HUD, only the engine overlay),
`hello-world` (a bare-bones starter kept as a minimal reference, with no demo UI at all), `hypercube` (a full-canvas
tesseract with no shared UI kit), and `logo-lowres` (a full-canvas showcase with no demo HUD):

| File | What it provides |
| --- | --- |
| `ui.js` | The single entry point demos import: `applyTheme()` and the `ui` object |
| `ui-core.js` | Immediate-mode context: layout anchors, pooled draw commands, hit testing |
| `ui-widgets.js` | Panels, labels, key-value rows, checkboxes, pips, buttons, sliders, meters |
| `ui-theme.js` | `applyTheme(palette)` - installs the 12 shared UI colors (slots 240-251 by default) |
| `ui-dpad.js` | The virtual touch D-pad (`ui.dpadWidget()`, `ui.dpad.isDown` / `ui.dpad.isPressed`) |
| `ui-gestures.js` | Swipe recognition (`ui.swipe()`) and invisible tap zones (`ui.tapIn()`) |
| `post-process-backend.js` | `isAvailable()` and `SOFTWARE_FALLBACK_NOTE` for effect demos that need WebGPU |

The kit is immediate mode: a demo declares its widgets every frame inside `render()`, and each widget answers a click, a
tap, or its bound key on the spot. Because every action is reachable by tap as well as by key, the demos are usable on a
phone without a keyboard.

## Browser and Renderer

The BLIT386 splash plays on [demos.blit386.dev](https://demos.blit386.dev) and in any local production build
(`pnpm run build && pnpm run preview`), because those read as release builds. It does not play under `pnpm run dev`,
where the `blit386()` Vite plugin marks the build as development. Add `?nosplash` to any demo URL to skip it.

BLIT386 uses two backends (WebGPU and Canvas 2D software). The default path is WebGPU (indexed framebuffer, full
post-process chain, CRT presets, and related demos). If WebGPU is unavailable or fails to initialize, the engine
automatically switches to a Canvas 2D software renderer. There is no on-canvas banner for this: the engine logs
`[BT] WebGPU unavailable, falling back to software renderer` to the browser console, and the engine overlay reports the
active backend in its status row (for example `software|320x240`). Demo code can query the same value at runtime with
`BT.activeBackend` (`'webgpu'` or `'software'`). You can force software mode with the `?backend=software` query on a
demo URL, or with `HardwareSettings.backend: 'software'` in a demo's `configure()`.

Most demos run in software mode for core drawing (sprites, primitives, palette, input). Post-process and fullscreen
effect stacks (for example the CRT demos) need WebGPU; effect-heavy demos skip those stacks in software mode and show an
on-screen note while the rest of the scene keeps running.

WebGPU support (for the full experience) is typical in:

| Browser | Version | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome/Edge | 113+ | Enabled by default |
| Firefox | 141+ (Windows) | Enabled by default; 145+/147+ on macOS; Nightly on Linux |
| Safari | 26+ | Enabled by default; Safari 18-25 available via Feature Flags |

## How to Run

You need both the `blit386` engine and `blit386-demos` set up as a pnpm workspace. See
[docs/EXTERNAL-DEVELOPER-SETUP.md](docs/EXTERNAL-DEVELOPER-SETUP.md) for the full setup guide.

Once the workspace is ready:

```bash
cd blit386-demos
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

The dev server opens `http://localhost:5173/demos/basics.html` in your browser (configured by `server.open` in
`vite.config.js`). Every demo is served at `http://localhost:5173/demos/<slug>.html`, and the index listing all of them
is at `http://localhost:5173/demos/`. Vintage numbered paths redirect to the current slug in both dev (301 from the Vite
plugin) and production (`dist/_redirects`). For the public build, open the flat URLs on
[demos.blit386.dev](https://demos.blit386.dev/).

Editing a demo's `src/<slug>.js` file usually avoids a full page reload: a method-only edit (`render()`/`update()`)
keeps state in place, while an edit to `init()` or the constructor re-initializes the demo instead. A `configure()`
hardware-setting change still forces a full reload - see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md#hot-reload) for the full tier breakdown.

## Social metadata and OG images

Every demo page ships a full social head block: a meta description, `rel=canonical`, favicon links, OpenGraph tags, and
a `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD block. It is assembled by `plugins/social-meta.js` and rendered into
`_partials/layout.html` through the `{{socialMeta}}` placeholder. All URLs in it are absolute and channel-aware, so the
`next` preview deploy never advertises production URLs.

The description comes from a **required** `@description` tag in each demo's header comment:

```js
// @description Classic retro color rotation with BT.paletteCycle: rotate palette slots to make a still image flow.
```

One line, 60-104 characters, ending in a period, within the first 2000 bytes of the file. `pnpm run check:demo-registry`
enforces every one of those rules, so a new demo cannot ship without one.

Each demo also has a 1200x630 OpenGraph card committed under `public/social/og-<slug>.png`. Cards are captured by hand,
never in CI, and need `agent-browser` and `ffmpeg` on `PATH`. `pnpm run check:demo-registry` fails if a demo's card is
missing - a new demo cannot ship without one, even though capturing stays a manual step.

**After changing a demo, re-capture its card.** Build, serve, then capture that one slug:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

```bash
pnpm run preview
```

Then, from a second terminal (check the port `preview` printed - it falls back to 4174 and up when 4173 is taken):

```bash
pnpm run capture:og -- <slug> --force --base-url http://localhost:4173
```

Two things to know:

- **`--force` is required.** Without it the script skips every slug that already has a card, so it silently does
  nothing.
- **It must be `preview`, not `dev`.** `--base-url` has to serve flattened, extensionless URLs - production, the `next`
  channel, or `pnpm run preview`. The dev server routes demos at `/demos/<slug>.html` and will not work.

Then look at the PNG before committing it. If the frame is unrepresentative (too dark, caught mid-transition), add a
settle override to `OG_CAPTURE_OVERRIDES` in `scripts/capture-og-image.mjs`; if the framing is the problem, set
`// @ogScale fit` or `// @ogScale integer` in the demo header instead.

Swap the slug for `--all` to redo every card. The default `auto` scaling takes a whole-number factor when that already
fills the card and fills the frame otherwise. Because PNGs do not delta-compress in git, prefer re-capturing only what
changed over re-running `--all --force`.
