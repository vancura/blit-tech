# {{projectName}}

A little pixel game built with [BLIT386](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386).

## Run it

You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed once (download the big LTS button). Then, in this folder:

```bash
{{pmInstall}}
{{pmRunDev}}
```

A web address like `http://localhost:5173` appears. Open it in your browser to play.

- Phone or tablet: tap or drag - the paddle follows your finger.
- Computer: move the mouse to steer the paddle, or use the left and right arrow keys as a fallback.

Catch the falling blocks before they reach the bottom.

## Change the game

Open `{{gameFile}}`. Every line has a comment explaining what it does. Change a number or a color, save the file, and
your browser updates by itself - most edits keep the game running (hot reload) instead of wiping your score. Edit a PNG
or sound under `public/` and that asset updates in place too. A few things to try:

- Make the blocks fall faster: find `ITEM_FALL_SPEED`.
- Make the paddle wider or narrower: `PADDLE_WIDTH`.
- Change the colors: the `palette.set(...)` lines in `init`.

More about hot reload: `docs/hot-reload.md`.

## Helpful commands

- `{{pmRunDev}}` - start the game (the everyday command).
- `npx blit run` - the same thing, the friendly way.
- `npx blit doctor` - check your setup if something seems off.
- `npx blit upgrade` - update BLIT386 to the latest version.

The `blit` helper is installed inside this project, not on your whole computer, so it needs `npx` in front (it means
"run the helper that lives in this project"). Typing plain `blit` would say "command not found."

## Peek behind the scenes

While the game runs, you can open the engine overlay - a small panel showing frames per second and which renderer is
active.

- Keyboard: press the key just below Esc, in the very top-left corner of your keyboard. On US keyboards it is printed
  with `` ` `` and `~`. Classic PC games like Quake used that exact key to open their command console, and BLIT386 keeps
  the tradition. The engine listens for the key's position, not the symbol printed on it - on some keyboard layouts the
  `~` symbol sits somewhere else entirely, but the overlay key is still the one below Esc.
- No keyboard, or can't find the key? Click or tap the bottom-left corner of the game screen instead. That works
  everywhere: phones, tablets, the Steam Deck.

## Share your game

When you want to show your game to a friend:

```bash
{{pmRunBuild}}
```

This packs everything into a `dist/` folder - a plain website, no server needed. Drag that folder onto a free static
host such as [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop) or [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com), and you
get a link anyone can open.

## When something breaks

It will - that is normal. Open `docs/when-something-breaks.md`. It explains how to read error messages and walks through
the usual suspects: blank screens, "command not found," forgotten `await`, and more.
