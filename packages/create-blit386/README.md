# create-blit386

Scaffold a new [BLIT386](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386) game in seconds.

## Usage

```bash
npm create blit386@latest my-game
cd my-game
npm run dev
```

The scaffolder installs the dependencies for you, so there is no `npm install` step. (If you passed `--no-install`, run
your install command first.)

Works with npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun - the scaffolder uses whichever you ran it with.

## What you get

- A small, complete starter game (Catcher) with a comment on every line - JavaScript by default, or TypeScript with
  `--ts`.
- A ready-to-run Vite setup: `index.html`, `src/game.js` (or `src/game.ts`), and a dev server.
- Local guides (`docs/`) and an `AGENTS.md` so you - or an AI assistant - can learn the engine without leaving the
  project.
- The `blit` helper CLI (`npx blit run`, `npx blit doctor`, `npx blit upgrade`, `npx blit migrate`,
  `npx blit agents sync`), provided by [`@blit386/kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blit386/kit). It is a
  project-local bin, so invoke it through `npx`.

If you pick an AI assistant in the wizard, the scaffolder also generates its config (Claude: `CLAUDE.md` + `.claude/`
including `settings.json` hooks, plus `.mcp.json`; Cursor: `.cursor/` including `hooks.json` and `mcp.json`) from the
kit's canonical content, and `npx blit agents sync` keeps it current. The MCP config registers the BLIT386 documentation
server, so your assistant can search the live docs at blit386.dev instead of guessing; Claude Code asks once whether to
allow it. Did not pick one at the start? Run `npx blit agents add claude` or `npx blit agents add cursor` later to set
it up.

## Options

```bash
npm create blit386@latest my-game -- --yes         # skip the prompts (JavaScript, no AI files, no CI)
npm create blit386@latest my-game -- --ts          # use the TypeScript starter instead of JavaScript
npm create blit386@latest my-game -- --no-install  # do not install dependencies
npm create blit386@latest my-game -- --no-git      # do not initialize a git repository
```

Without an interactive terminal - an AI assistant or a CI job running the command - there is nobody to answer the
prompts, so the scaffolder behaves as if you passed `--yes` and says so once. `--ts` still applies. Pass `--yes`
yourself to silence the notice.

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.18.0 or newer.
- A modern browser. WebGPU is used when available; otherwise the engine falls back to Canvas 2D automatically, so the
  game always runs.
