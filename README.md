BLIT386 is a palette-first retro game engine for the web, and this repository is the whole project - the engine, the
scaffolder that writes you a running game in one command, a few dozen commented demos, and the site that documents them.
Palette-first means you draw with numbered colors rather than RGBA pixels, so changing what color 3 _means_ recolors
everything drawn in it at once: a few bytes of palette upload, and water flows or the sky goes dark without a single
pixel being redrawn. TypeScript throughout, WebGPU where the browser has it, an automatic Canvas 2D fallback where it
does not.

## Quick start

You do not need to know anything about this repository to start. One command writes a complete, running project:

```bash
npm create blit386@latest my-game
cd my-game
npm run dev
```

It works with npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun - whichever you ran it with. Open the address it prints, edit `src/game.js`, and
the page updates as you type. The generated project comes with a starter game, local documentation, and the `blit` CLI.

Already have a project and just want the engine in it? That path starts at
[`packages/blit386`](packages/blit386/README.md).

## What is in here

| Package | npm | What it is |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`packages/blit386`](packages/blit386) | [`blit386`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/blit386) | The engine: palette, sprites, text, input, audio, seeded random, easing, post-process effects |
| [`packages/create-blit386`](packages/create-blit386) | [`create-blit386`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-blit386) | The scaffolder behind `npm create blit386@latest` |
| [`packages/kit`](packages/kit) | [`@blit386/kit`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@blit386/kit) | What a generated game gets: starter docs, game-author skills, the `blit` CLI |
| [`packages/demos`](packages/demos) | not published | The examples running at demos.blit386.dev |
| [`packages/website`](packages/website) | not published | The docs site at blit386.dev |

The engine, the kit, and the scaffolder release together under one shared version number, so a scaffolded game always
gets a kit that matches the engine it pins.
