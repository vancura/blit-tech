# User-Facing Voice Guide

## Why This Exists

Error messages, canvas banners, and console output that reach a developer or end user define the first impression of the
engine. Blit-Tech targets two distinct audiences, and mixing their styles produces confusing output for both.

This guide defines the rules. Before writing any `throw`, `console.error`, `displayError`, or canvas-visible string,
read the relevant section below.

---

## Two Audience Tiers

### Tier 1 — User-facing (canvas-visible or public API errors)

Audience: demo authors using the `BT` namespace, beginners who may not know TypeScript internals.

Rules:

- Plain English. No jargon. No abbreviations.
- Explain what went wrong in one sentence.
- Give a concrete next action in the next sentence.
- No trailing period on thrown strings (thrown messages appear mid-sentence in stack traces).
- No emoji.
- No ALL_CAPS outside of identifiers quoted from source code.
- Consistent capitalization: sentence case, not title case.

Where it appears: `showBeginnerRuntimeError()`, `displayError()`, canvas banners, and `throw new Error()` on any public
API path (anything reachable from demo code via `BT.*` or a public constructor). All such messages must live in
`src/utils/errorMessages.ts`.

### Tier 2 — Internal invariants (developer-only)

Audience: engine contributors reading a stack trace.

Rules:

- Terse. Include the relevant values.
- No need to explain next steps — the reader can read the source.
- Still no emoji.

Where it appears: `throw new Error()` inside private engine methods, guard checks inside `src/core/`, `src/render/`, and
non-public `src/assets/` paths.

## Examples: Before and After

| Context                                | Before (avoid)                  | After (Tier 1 style)                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Canvas not found                       | `Element not found`             | `Can't find the canvas on the page. Make sure your HTML has a <canvas id='${canvasId}'> element.`                                                                      |
| No active palette                      | `No palette`                    | `No palette set yet. Call BT.paletteSet(somePalette) before drawing or running palette effects.`                                                                       |
| Palette index out of range             | `Index out of bounds: ${index}` | `The color number ${index} is too big for this palette. The palette has ${size} colors, so use a number from 0 to ${size - 1}.`                                        |
| Sprite not indexized                   | `Sheet not indexized`           | `This sprite sheet hasn't been prepared yet. Use SpriteSheet.loadIndexed(...) for one-step setup, or call sheet.indexize(palette) after BT.paletteSet.`                |
| Sprite color missing from palette      | `Color not found`               | `The pixel at (${x}, ${y}) in ${src} has the color ${hex}, but that color isn't in your palette. Either add ${hex} to the palette, or change that pixel in the image.` |
| Wrong drawPixel arguments              | `TypeError: bad args`           | `drawPixel expects (x, y, paletteIndex) or (Vector2i, paletteIndex). Got: [${typeDetails}]`                                                                            |
| Missing await on async load            | `Promise passed to draw`        | `Did you forget to use 'await' before ${loadCall}?`                                                                                                                    |
| WebGPU adapter unavailable             | `WebGPU failed`                 | `Your computer's graphics card couldn't start WebGPU. Try updating your browser, or check that hardware acceleration is enabled.`                                      |
| HUD start slot below 1                 | `Invalid startSlot`             | `HUD preset slots start from 1 (slot 0 is always transparent). Got ${startSlot}.`                                                                                      |
| Tier 2 (internal) palette byte missing | _(fine as-is)_                  | `Palette byte ${index} is missing`                                                                                                                                     |

## Console Output Rules

- Prefix engine console output with `[BT]`: `console.error('[BT] Palette Error: ...')`.
- Use `console.error` for failures, `console.warn` for degraded-but-continuing states.
- Never use `console.log` in production code paths (benchmarks and debug utilities excepted).
- Canvas-visible errors (`displayError`) and console output must say the same thing. Do not show a terse console message
  and a friendly canvas message — they must match.

---

## Centralization

All Tier 1 message strings live in `src/utils/errorMessages.ts`. Every public-facing throw and every
`showBeginnerRuntimeError` call imports from there. This guarantees:

- Identical wording across every call site.
- A single place to audit and update the tone.
- Easy unit testing of message content.

Steps when adding a new Tier 1 message:

1. Add an exported function or constant to `src/utils/errorMessages.ts`.
2. Import and call it at the throw or display site.
3. Do not inline the string at the call site.

Tier 2 strings (internal invariants) may be inlined — they are never user-visible and do not need the same stability
guarantees.

## Quick Self-Check Before Committing a New Message

1. **Plain English?** Could a junior developer understand it without reading engine source?
2. **Next action?** Does it tell the reader what to do, not just what failed?
3. **No trailing period?** Thrown strings land mid-sentence in stack traces.
4. **No emoji?** Nowhere in the engine — not in throws, not in banners, not in console output.
5. **Sentence case?** "Slot 0 is always transparent" not "Slot 0 Is Always Transparent".
6. **Centralized?** Is the string in `errorMessages.ts`, or must it go there?
7. **Tier correct?** Is this reachable from demo code? If yes, it must be Tier 1.
