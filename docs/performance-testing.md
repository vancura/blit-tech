# Performance Testing

Blit-Tech has CPU micro-benchmarks for hot methods. This guide explains when to use them, how to add a new benchmark,
and how CI uses the results.

## Overview

Blit-Tech uses Vitest bench for CPU micro-benchmarks. These measure isolated methods, hot loops, cache lookups, math
helpers, and allocation patterns.

For visual correctness (not performance), use the visual regression tests: `pnpm test:visual`. They run Playwright with
Chromium + WebGPU and produce PNG snapshots. See `docs/testing.md` for details.

### CPU Benchmarks

Use CPU benchmarks when you want to measure a single method, hot loop, cache lookup, math helper, allocation pattern, or
batching helper in isolation.

Examples:

- `Vector2i.add()` vs `Vector2i.addInPlace()`
- `Color32.toFloat32Array()` vs `Color32.writeToFloat32Array()`
- `BitmapFont.measureText()` cold vs warm cache
- `Rect2i.containsXY()` vs `Rect2i.contains()`

---

## CPU Benchmarks

CPU benchmarks are implemented with Vitest bench and colocated next to the source as `*.bench.ts` files.

Current benchmark files:

- `src/utils/Vector2i.bench.ts`
- `src/utils/Color32.bench.ts`
- `src/utils/Rect2i.bench.ts`
- `src/assets/BitmapFont.bench.ts`
- `src/assets/PaletteEffect.bench.ts`

### Metrics

CPU benchmarks report **ops/sec**. Higher numbers are better.

If one benchmark shows:

- `20,000,000 ops/sec`

and another shows:

- `10,000,000 ops/sec`

the first one is roughly twice as fast.

### Why This Is the Default Choice

CPU benchmarks are:

- faster to run locally
- easier to write
- easier to reason about
- already integrated into CI regression checks when the PR is labeled `perf`

If you add a new hot method and want immediate automated regression protection, this is the first tool to use.

## Adding a New CPU Benchmark

If you add a new method and it can run without a browser, start here.

### File Location

Create or extend a `*.bench.ts` file near the code being measured.

Examples:

```text
src/utils/MyType.bench.ts
src/render/SpritePipeline.bench.ts
```

### Basic Structure

```ts
import { bench, describe } from 'vitest';

import { MyType } from './MyType';

describe('MyType hot paths', () => {
  const instance = new MyType();

  bench('newMethod()', () => {
    instance.newMethod();
  });

  bench('oldMethod()', () => {
    instance.oldMethod();
  });
});
```

### What to Compare

Good benchmark comparisons usually measure one meaningful tradeoff:

- new method vs previous method
- allocating vs in-place
- small input vs large input
- cold cache vs warm cache
- vector argument vs raw `x, y` argument

### Benchmark Design Rules

- keep the benchmark focused on one hot behavior
- use realistic inputs, not absurd synthetic values unless stress testing is intentional
- compare alternatives in the same file so the relative result is obvious
- prefer stable setup outside the `bench(...)` callback
- if mutation is involved, reset state inside the benchmark or in setup so each iteration is valid

### Run CPU Benchmarks

```bash
pnpm bench
pnpm bench:json
```

`pnpm bench` gives the terminal report.

`pnpm bench:json` writes `benchmark-results.json`, which is what CI uses.

---

## Commands

```bash
pnpm bench       # Run all CPU benchmarks
pnpm bench:json  # Run benchmarks and write benchmark-results.json
```

### Which Command Should I Use?

- **New hot method:** `pnpm bench`
- **Need machine-readable result for comparison:** `pnpm bench:json`

---

## CI Benchmark Workflow

CPU benchmark regression detection is wired into GitHub Actions.

### What Happens on `main`

On pushes to `main`, CI:

1. runs `pnpm bench:json`
2. produces `benchmark-results.json`
3. uploads that file as the latest benchmark baseline artifact

That artifact becomes the reference point for future pull requests.

### What Happens on a Pull Request

On PRs targeting `main` with the `perf` label, CI:

1. runs the normal `quality` job first
2. runs the `benchmark` job
3. runs `pnpm bench:json`
4. downloads the latest successful `main` benchmark baseline artifact
5. compares PR results against the `main` baseline
6. posts or updates a PR comment with a benchmark comparison table
7. fails the job if any benchmark is more than **10% slower**

PRs without the `perf` label skip the benchmark job to reduce CI cost.

### What the PR Comment Contains

The comparison comment includes:

- benchmark name
- baseline ops/sec
- current ops/sec
- delta percent
- pass/fail status

### What Counts as Failure

The benchmark CI job fails if:

- any benchmark regresses by more than 10%
- a previously existing benchmark disappears from the PR run

## Recommended Workflow for New Performance Work

If you add a new sprite operation, follow this order:

1. **Write the code clearly first.**
2. **Add a CPU benchmark** if the method can run in Node.
3. **Run `pnpm bench` locally** to compare the new method against the old behavior or an alternative implementation.
4. **Run `pnpm bench:json`** if you want to inspect the machine-readable output used by CI.
5. **Open a PR** and add the `perf` label for CPU benchmark comparison.

### Best Default

If you are unsure where to start:

- use **CPU benchmarking** with Vitest bench

It is simple, fast, and already supported by the label-gated benchmark CI.
